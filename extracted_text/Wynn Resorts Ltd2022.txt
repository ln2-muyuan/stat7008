transaction or a given situation is reasonably unclear or uncertain. We assess tax laws to
support the commercial and investment objectives of our business. We assess the tax
treatment of material transactions and new business developments. Where more than one
legal option is available, the most tax efficient method may be pursued. When appropriate to
our business, we will seek to apply tax incentives and exemptions in the manner in which they
are intended.

Workplace Security Program
Guest safety and workplace security are essential to our services provided at our North
American properties. Our security departments consist of multiple sections that form a
layered system responsible for the deterrence, detection, and response to any threat at our
resorts. The security departments have specialized teams dedicated to crisis management,
tactical response, K9, and a full complement of security officers. The security departments
also use weapon detection equipment as a preventative measure on our properties.
At Wynn Las Vegas, the corporate investigation team liaises with external law enforcement
agencies regarding events involving our resorts and employees. Additionally, the Las Vegas
Metropolitan Police Department is present at Wynn and Encore Las Vegas during all major
special events. At Encore Boston Harbor, state and local law enforcement maintain a
presence 24/7/365.
Wynn Resorts enforces a strict no-weapons policy at our properties. Security personnel
are trained on all written policies and procedures upon hiring, including regular drills for
emergency evacuations, emergency communications systems, and critical incidents.
Behind every procedure and policy are the foundational laws that uphold human rights and
civil rights. All internal policy and training include local laws, lawful detainment, and term of
detainment.
Our resorts were designed to exceed fire safety standards required by building code. Staffed
by 24/7 personnel, a centralized fire command system monitors the status of every smoke
alarm and sprinkler at the resorts. Surveillance systems monitor all guest areas, including
gaming. To ensure safety through the possibility of natural disasters, our Business Continuity

procedures
To empower employees to promote security in the workplace, year-round educational
security campaigns take place around employee workspaces. Educational trainings include
“See Something, Say Something,” Human Trafficking Prevention Awareness Training, and
Health and Safety Guidance. We conduct security and safety briefings prior to all major
holidays and significant major events. These briefings include a cross section of every
department on each property. Employees also can communicate directly with security
officers at any time through various communication channels.
Our surveillance department is responsible for observing and reporting activity viewed
through the closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera system and live casino observation.
This department performs detailed observations and monitors the integrity of all gaming
areas by using various software programs to prepare evaluations, procedural audits and
concise reports. Surveillance is also responsible for protecting assets through monitoring
patrons and gaming employees for any cheating, fraud and suspicious activity and then
reporting activity to proper authority.
Surveillance also ensures the adherence to the Wynn System of Internal Controls and
the corporate compliance Anti-Money Laundering program and reports violations and/
or suspicious activity. In addition, Surveillance is responsible for observing and reporting
suspicious activity and/or suspected fraud for point-of-sale locations that include food and
beverage locations as well as various retail outlets.
There is an extensive training and education program for both operations as well as for
the technical division. In addition to operations, the technical division is responsible for
maintaining the overall CCTV system that incorporates various applications and new
technology. (Continued)
