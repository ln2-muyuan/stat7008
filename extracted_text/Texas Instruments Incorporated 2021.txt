Reducing cybersecurity risks
Our cybersecurity risk management process is based on best practice management and governance frameworks, such as the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology.
Using guidance from these organizations and information collected from our assessments, we develop cybersecurity plans, policies and protocols to reduce our risks and
strengthen our security posture to protect our company, technology and intellectual property (IP). Our policies include defining the acceptable use of our information assets,
access requirements for specific IP or technologies, protecting personal information and privacy, and complying with regulations such as the General Data Protection
Regulation and the China Cybersecurity Law.
Our global information security team identifies and responds to potential threats and works with our business units and support teams to improve security.
As part of this, we take these types of actions:

• Requiring our hiring and development managers to complete unconscious bias training.
• Making unconscious bias content available in performance management workshops and directly to TIers through our learning and development system.
• Training leaders how to understand and recognize unconscious bias before conducting talent reviews. For example, leaders use specific and
objective criteria to assess professional growth and gather independent feedback from multiple sources when assessing job performance.

Liz reflected on how TI and the military have a similar way
of approaching challenges:
“Both focus on working the problem and relying on a team
to create a solution. The military and TI have taught me
about leadership and understanding that sometimes you
have to put the needs and goals of your team ahead of
yourself. As a TIer, veteran and working mom, I draw on the
lessons I learned in the Army about integrity, duty, honor
and respect. Those same qualities carried over into my

Accelerating the development of technical women
TI’s Women for Technical Leadership (WFTL) program provides coaching, formal training, roundtables and relationship-building
opportunities to inspire a more diverse pool of talent for the Tech Ladder and to help retain, develop and move women into leadership
roles. WFTL has helped increase the number women elected to TI’s Tech Ladder by nearly 50% since its formation in 2016.
“When Women for Technical Leadership was formed in 2016, we were seeing women participate in elections at roughly half the rate
of men,“ said Yesenia Moore, vice president of diversity and inclusion. “We have seen marked improvement in the participation rates
of women in the Tech Ladder election over the past five years. This is encouraging for progress yet to come.”
Amos Tang, a member of the 2021 cohort, was recently elected to the Tech Ladder and looks forward to inspiring other women to apply.
“The training sessions and roundtables with leadership gave me a new perspective as a technical leader,” she said. “This program
is about self-confidence, how we express ourselves and how we connect with others. It also inspires us to continue mentoring and
advocating to lead others to succeed.”
Kiki Schuck participated in WFTL and was elected to Tech Ladder early in her career. She said, “Participating in WFTL and being
elected to the Tech Ladder helped me to find my voice and have more confidence. Having this recognition from my peers and being
elected into this group of technologists gave me self-confidence as I approach new opportunities, solve problems and innovate.”

Global week of impact
TI’s employee-led community involvement teams joined together
during the holiday season, focused on gratitude and giving, to
volunteer and give back to build stronger communities. Across the
globe, they expressed thanks to those who keep us healthy and safe,
and made life a little easier for those facing hardships, helping our
neighbors in areas many of us take for granted.
Essential workers at hospital systems and fire stations in northern
California and in Dallas, Texas, were shown appreciation through
meals, thank you notes and goody bags for the “superhero” efforts
they made throughout the year to keep our communities safe
and healthy.
Global volunteering efforts focused on our most vulnerable neighbors

with local partners to ensure that hundreds of children and young
adults in Germany, the Philippines, Texas and Utah received gifts,

Texas, received basic home and hygiene items and notes of
encouragement from our employees.
In Japan, teams collected food items for food-insecure families
near our Miho manufacturing site. In Sherman, Texas, TIers
fulfilled wish-list items for local charities who work with previously
incarcerated youth and victims of domestic abuse. And in Tucson
and Dallas, TIers and their families transformed more than 600 rocks

compliance officer, senior vice president of human resources, and ethics and compliance directors collaborate with other stakeholders to oversee and coordinate ethics and compliance programs
across TI. They periodically share updates and results with the board of directors’ Audit Committee, senior managers and other executives to drive continuous and effective improvement.
TIers are encouraged to raise questions or concerns about conduct that may be inconsistent with Living our values. TI will not tolerate retaliation against those who have reported an issue in good
faith. Anyone who retaliates against an employee for these activities is subject to disciplinary action, including termination.

See the Risk Management and Business Continuity section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for more information about TI’s risk management and business continuity practices.
Governance
TI takes a holistic approach to risk management to build a culture that minimizes risk exposures and protects shareholder value. TI’s Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for financial risk
(accounting, finance, internal controls and tax strategy). Our board of directors’ committees share oversight responsibility for compliance risk.
TI also has a Business Continuity steering team that oversees its business continuity strategy, policy, program and plans. Team members meet regularly to discuss risks, best practices and
Effectiveness of implementation plans and take a lead role if disruptive events occur. They also provide an annual update to the chief financial officer.
102-30 risk-management processes
Monitoring risks
All TI organizations and teams are expected to identify potential risks to employees, business practices, the supply chain and the environment. They conduct formal risk assessments and invest in
controls that benefit our company, customers and communities. We then validate and monitor findings until actions are complete. Each quarter, we report risks and mitigation plans to senior managers.
We also annually disclose risks in SEC form 10-K.
Grievance channels
Stakeholders can contact ti.com/support or their account managers with any risk-related questions, concerns or grievances.

102-42 Identifying and selecting stakeholders We engage with stakeholders who directly influence or are interested in our operations.
We tailor our dynamic engagement strategies, methodologies and communications to the unique interests of the people and organizations that directly influence or have an interest in our operations.
Engagement mechanisms generally include meetings, calls and emails and vary in frequency. Our senior leaders regularly share stakeholder feedback on ESG matters with the executive team and
board of directors.
102-43 Approach to stakeholder engagement
Stakeholders can ask questions or share opinions through our website (TI.com), email address (citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com) and social media channels. We have an accounting and audit hotline for
addressing accounting- and audit-related topics and relate all inquiries received on the hotline to the Audit Committee chair of our board of directors.

Procurement practices
Indicator Description Response
See the Supply-Chain Responsibility section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s supplier website to learn more about the company’s management approach.
Governance
TI’s vice president of worldwide procurement and logistics, who reports directly to the chief financial officer, leads supply-chain management. Together, they oversee supply-
chain policies, performance and risk management. TI’s director of supply-chain responsibility oversees supplier social responsibility and manages supplier diversity.
Codes of conduct
TI suppliers must adhere to TI’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which uses the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) code of conduct as its foundation and includes environmental
standards specifically applicable to TI’s suppliers.
Engagement
When initiating relationships with suppliers, we educate them about our standards and expectations for safe, humane and ethical labor practices, as well as human trafficking,
forced labor and workers’ rights. We communicate these guidelines in meetings; on our supplier website; and in purchase orders, supplier contracts and other related
documents. We also routinely engage and collaborate with industry groups such as the RBA, the Semiconductor Industry Association, and Semiconductor Equipment and
Materials International to discuss and create supply-chain standards and share best management practices.
Training
We deliver online and in-person training on our Supplier Code of Conduct, standards and expectations. We also leverage RBA’s training programs to help suppliers understand
103-1 to 103-3 Disclosure of management approach
the alliance’s code of conduct, labor risks, respecting workers’ rights, hiring migrant workers and more.
Conflict minerals
TI is an early member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), created by RBA/Global E-Sustainability Initiative members, that works to advance effective policies that
address conflict mineral concerns. TI works diligently with our supply chain, including subcontracted manufacturers, to identify and eliminate noncompliant sources of material.
Grievance mechanisms
TI has established grievance mechanisms to ensure that its buyers or procurement representatives meet with suppliers to address any questions or concerns. Our Supply-Chain
Management team can also assist with identifying and addressing issues inconsistent with our ethics and values. If suppliers (or employees or contractors of suppliers) prefer,
they can contact our Ethics Office to ask questions or discuss issues anonymously.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires our suppliers to establish and maintain programs that ensure the confidentiality, anonymity and protection of supplier and employee
whistleblowers unless prohibited by law. Suppliers must have a communicated process for their personnel to raise any concerns without fear of retaliation.
Resources
TI allocates extensive financial, human, training, information and engagement resources to help suppliers understand its policies and expectations, roles and responsibilities,
performance and ethics expectations, and environmental, safety and health (ESH) and labor protections.

Environment standards – ESH
Indicator Description Response
See the Environmental Sustainability section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and the associated ESH indicators in this GRI Index to learn more about how TI manages ESH.
Governance
See Board Oversight of ESG Matters.
Management system
Our ESH management system facilitates the planning, execution, evaluation and management oversight of activities and strategies. It meets certification requirements set by the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (environmental management system criteria) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management system criteria). Our management system also contains programs,
policies, controls, processes and measurement tools based on industry best practices and international standards. It helps us mitigate risks, improve our performance, fulfill compliance obligations and achieve
our objectives. Programs include extensive chemical and material screening, material sourcing, waste profiling, emissions management, and responsible recycling and disposal. We require 100% of our employees
and supplemental contractors at all TI manufacturing and assembly/test sites to adhere to management system requirements. Other personnel not managed by TI are responsible for following their companies’
ESH management procedures and applicable regulatory requirements.
Goals
TI sets company wide and/or site-specific GHG emission reduction, landfill diversion, water conservation and energy reduction goals. We track and report the effectiveness of these initiatives to
senior leaders quarterly.
Policies
TI’s ESH Policy is available in multiple languages: English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Spanish, German and Korean. TI’s Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of
conduct also includes sections on protecting human health and the environment.
Engagement
We evaluate the potential positive and negative impacts of a proposed project on a community by conducting environmental impact assessments before site selection.
Disclosure of management
103-1 to 103-3
approach Assessment
To ensure that our internal management system is effective, the Worldwide ESH Compliance Support team and independent third parties perform audits at each facility every three years; in interim years,
the facilities perform self-assessments. They examine compliance with legal and TI standards and training effectiveness. Additionally, we:
• Survey employees and external stakeholders.
• Conduct legally required inspections and monitor incident rates.
• Benchmark against the RBA’s self-assessment disclosure and its code of conduct and against peers and members of the Semiconductor Industry Association.
• Have select sites third-party audited under the RBA’s Validated Audit Process.
We communicate gaps and best practices to other sites so that similar issues will not occur. Each manufacturing site also reports performance using a scorecard that measures energy use, water efficiency
and landfill diversion. We share scorecards internally for transparency and best-practice awareness and as an accountability mechanism. We have not made significant adjustments to our corporate-level ESH
management system because of audit findings.
Grievance channels
We offer several channels through which internal and external stakeholders can submit ESH questions, concerns or grievances. All employees and supplemental contractors have “stop work” authority to remove
themselves from work situations that they believe could cause injury, illness or environmental harm. They also can contact their supervisor, site ESH staff or anonymously contact the TI Ethics Office. Customers
can contact ti.com/support or direct all other ESH-related inquiries to citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com.
Resources
TI allocates extensive financial, human, training and communication resources to help TIers monitor and control potential ESH impacts, protect employee health and safety, understand specific ESH roles and
responsibilities and drive improvements. We provide our ESH team with extensive training and tools to implement appropriate industry best practices and comply with regulatory requirements. To guide these
efforts, we require employees and supplemental contractors at all manufacturing and assembly/test sites to adhere to our ESH Policy and Principles.

See the Energy section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report. Our 2021 energy intensity ratio was 0.30. We divide the total energy consumption by the number of
wafer chips (not including external manufacturing) produced each year when calculating energy intensity. We then compare this to a 2005 base year to report a ratio
302-3 Energy intensity
based only on internal energy consumption. The energy types included in the ratio are natural gas, gasoline, diesel, electricity, propane, fuel oil, liquid petroleum gas
and district heating.
See the Energy section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for reduction data. Energy conservation savings are based on electricity, fuel and heating projects.
302-4 Reduction of energy consumption The basis for calculation is the estimated annualized reduction for each project, with the total reported as the sum of all annualized savings estimates. We validate

Indicator Description Response
There have not been water impacts directly attributed to discharges and runoff at any TI site. We sustain this by maintaining compliance with discharge limits in our
permits, following TI standards, and ensuring that sites follow good housekeeping practices and actively collaborate to continuously improve and minimize exposure
to water pathways. See the Water Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s 2022 CDP Water Security response to learn more about how
TI interacts with water and collaborates with stakeholders regarding this shared resource.
303-1 Interactions with water as a shared resource
All of TI’s main manufacturing and assembly/test facilities set annual water reduction goals based on projects they identified as part of the company’s ongoing energy
and water reduction program. Sites decide which projects to pursue based on various factors, including economic payback and impact on process system stability
and reliability. Public policy and water stress factor into these decisions indirectly. Public policy and water stress impact the cost and availability of water, making
water reductions more attractive from a financial standpoint or if they are necessary for system reliability.
See the Water Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s 2022 CDP Water Security response to learn more about wastewater
management. Local regulatory agencies set minimum quality standards for effluents, which all TI sites manage to permissible limits. Some regulators incorporate
sector-specific standards to set their requirements.
303-2 Management of water discharge-related impacts
Our internal water-management standard includes guidelines that ensure compliance with wastewater, stormwater and sewage discharge permits and other
requirements. Sites monitor water quality and have procedures to manage spills or other abnormalities. We report wastewater discharges and the portion of total
water discharged through regulated wastewater treatment points to local, state, federal and international regulatory agencies.
See the Water Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for water withdrawal data. Municipal sources and groundwater supply our water.
303-3 Water withdrawal
We calculate consumption from sites TI fully controls and that are larger than 50,000 square feet.
Federal, state or local regulators create wastewater permits that define and determine priority substances that must meet discharge limits. We comply with these
limits by treating water in onsite treatment plants, separating concentrated metals and solvents from waste streams, and other measures. See the Water Management
Total water discharge and priority discharges of concern for which section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for discharge data.

contractors, and workplace visitors. Our management approach includes several different elements:
• Formal ESH committees at our manufacturing sites, which include managers, ESH specialists and TIers, work with site managers to oversee health and safety
management systems.
• Manufacturing and assembly/test safety councils, comprising ESH and ergonomics representatives, drive a safety-focused manufacturing
culture within our facilities.
• Leaders at all levels support and reinforce consistent safety practices, including training and reporting.
103-1 to 103-3 Disclosure of management approach
• Employees are responsible for completing applicable training and keeping their work environments safe.

All TI sites are covered by occupational safety and health standards that help identify, evaluate and control potential workplace hazards. We holistically manage TIers’
mental and physical health and create monitoring plans to assess progress.
Assessments
Through routine programs, facility self-assessments and audits, work area sampling and health and safety surveys, we assess potential safety and health risks by:
• Performing a thorough investigation after all incidents and near misses to analyze the root cause and take corrective and preventive actions.
403-2 Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation
• Communicating lessons learned and corrective action plans to other sites and groups to avoid similar issues.
• Documenting all incidents for review by a central recordkeeping review panel, which ensures the quality and accuracy of each injury investigation
and its associated documentation.
• Conducting internal and external audits to verify the quality and effectiveness of our processes.
