About Vertex
We are a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people
with serious diseases. We have multiple approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) — a
rare, life-threatening genetic disease — and several ongoing clinical and research programs in CF. Beyond CF, we have a
robust pipeline of investigational small molecule, cell and genetic therapies in other serious diseases where we have deep
insight into causal human biology, including sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, pain,
type 1 diabetes, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We strongly commit to operating our
business responsibly and disclosing our progress to stakeholders on an annual basis. This report shares our ongoing work 1989 Founded

Improve the Lives of People
With Serious Diseases
At Vertex, we discover, develop and commercialize innovative medicines so
that people with serious diseases can lead better lives. We invest heavily in
scientific innovation and have several marketed medicines for the treatment
of cystic fibrosis (CF), as well as a broad research and development (R&D)
pipeline that targets additional disease areas where we have deep
insight into the causal human biology, notably sickle cell disease, beta
thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, pain, type 1 diabetes,
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
We fuel our success through serial innovation, an approach in which revenues and
profits obtained from discovering and bringing one medicine to market are used
to drive discovery and development of the next. Our 20+ year history in CF has
informed this approach and exemplifies its principles.

Access to Medicines
Our aim is for Vertex medicines to be accessible to as many patients as possible around the world. Our medicines are currently
approved and reimbursed in more than 30 countries globally, benefiting tens of thousands of patients on five continents, and
we are working to expand sustainable access to Vertex CF medicines across countries, age groups and mutations.
Securing approval and access for patients with complex, chronic conditions like CF has many challenges. CF is a lifelong
condition. Patient care and essential treatment must be maintained over the long-term, and it is vital that people with CF can
rely on, and be confident in, the continued supply of their medication.
By working collaboratively with various stakeholders in many countries, patients have access to our medicines through a range
of routes, including fully reimbursed commercial access, individual named patient sales and compassionate use. In 2021 alone,
we achieved over 25 new reimbursement agreements for our CF portfolio outside of the U.S., and, over the past two years, we
more than tripled the number of people living with CF with access to a CFTR modulator therapy. The vast majority of these
agreements include access to our triple combination therapy.
Patients across the U.S. have broad access to our medicines through private and public insurance, and through Vertex Guidance
& Patient Support™ (GPS) we have assistance programs in place for eligible patients who need additional help, including

Increasing Health Equity
As we enter new therapeutic areas and engage with new and diverse patient
populations, we recognize the painful history of racism and the historical
mistreatment of communities of color that has contributed to systemic health
inequities in many parts of the world. Removing systemic barriers to equitable
health care must be prioritized to close the gaps in health care research, access,
quality and patient outcomes for Black and other underrepresented communities.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Clinical Trials
Clinical trials should be representative of all people living with a specific disease.
Ensuring appropriate diversity in participant characteristics helps us to develop
and deliver innovative medicines that can make a meaningful difference in the
lives of all people living with that disease. We recognize that individuals may
respond differently to a given treatment based on their age, biological sex, weight,
race, ethnicity, geography and other factors. By providing equitable access to and
including people from diverse backgrounds and locations, clinical trials can show
if the treatments are safe and effective across patient populations.
Our aim is to sponsor inclusive clinical trials that represent the diversity of
people living with the disease. We have an internal initiative to embed the patient

voice into our clinical research areas. For diseases like sickle cell disease and

Reducing Emissions
We are committed to doing our part to mitigate climate change by managing our GHG emissions: setting ambitious targets,
19.7%
closely tracking our emissions, achieving reductions and reporting progress. Vertex has a global target to reduce absolute
GHG emissions by 20 percent by the end of 2023 over a 2018 baseline, which we consider aligned with the science-based reduction in absolute greenhouse
targets initiative. This builds upon our previous achievement of reducing our absolute GHG emissions by 39 percent from gas (GHG) emissions since 2018
2015 to 2019. We continue to make progress toward our 2023 goal with a 19.7 percent reduction in absolute GHG emissions
as of December 31, 2021.
100%
Using Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance, we determined that our total 2020 Scope 3 emissions were 206,332 MT CO2e. This

services, capital goods, fuel and energy-related activities, upstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in
operations, business travel, employee commuting and upstream leased assets. We plan to report Scope 3 on an annual basis
starting in the 2022 reporting year.
Energy use is a primary driver of our emissions, so energy management is a key aspect of our reduction strategy. The
Leiden Center in Boston was designed to maximize energy efficiency and will feature a new solar array on an adjacent
property that will supply up to 15 percent of the electricity demand for the facility. Our international headquarters in London Global GHG Emissions1

Assessing Climate Risk ‘18

We conducted a climate risk assessment to identify, assess and quantify our climate-related risks and opportunities. Vertex
is relatively unexposed to transition risk, or the risk to our business associated with the transition toward a lower-carbon
economy, out to 2030. Our greatest climate risks can be attributed to the location of our facilities in Boston’s Innovation ‘20
District; however, we believe that our existing flood mitigation processes including waterproofing, watertight doors,
storm-resistant glass and flood barriers are sufficient to counteract wind and rain events across our facilities. ‘21
We communicate our climate change risks and associated opportunities through the CDP Climate Change Disclosure,
which is aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). In 2021,
we received a B score.
