Percentage grid electricity 87.1 88.9 Pending independent assurance
Percentage renewable energy 6.7 11.3 Pending independent assurance
Total energy consumed is calculated based on emissions sources included in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, namely natural gas, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, propane, kerosene, compressed natural gas, B02,
B05, B11, B20, E85, methanol, ethanol, electricity, steam and chilled water.
Percentage grid electricity is calculated as total electricity consumed as purchased from the grid (and reported for scope 2 GHG emissions) divided by total energy consumed.
Percentage renewable electricity is calculated as total renewable electricity generated on-site or purchased in the form of energy attribute certificates divided by total energy consumed.

See Data privacy for a discussion of Verizon’s corporate policies and operating procedures governing how we collect, use, retain and protect data.
TC-TL-220a.2 Percentage of customers whose information is used for secondary purposes 100 100 100
The reported metric is 100% because, as described in the Verizon Privacy Policy, Verizon uses customer data to improve our products and services, which is one of the ways that the SASB Standard defines
“secondary purposes” for purposes of this metric.
TC-TL-220a.3 Total amount of significant monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings Not significant Not significant Not significant
associated with privacy
For purposes of reporting this metric, we have established a significance threshold that is lower than the materiality threshold for reporting legal proceedings in our SEC reports and will report any loss of
$100 million or more, individually or in the aggregate.
TC-TL-220a.4 Number of U.S. law enforcement requests for customer information 156,000+ 155,000+ 173,000+
Number of customer selectors whose information was requested 292,000+ 311,000+ 315,000+
Percentage resulting in disclosure 90.4 90.3 89.6
The metrics include subpoenas, warrants and orders that we receive from federal, state and local law enforcement in the U.S., but do not include wiretap orders, pen register and trap and trace orders, national
security demands and emergency requests, which we separately report in our Transparency Report. A customer selector is an information point, such as a telephone number, used to identify a customer.
Verizon does not maintain a record of unique customers whose information was requested because multiple selectors may refer to the same customer (e.g., the same person may have multiple phone
numbers) and selectors may be duplicated across requests (e.g., the same phone number requested in two subpoenas is counted as two selectors). We define a disclosure as a full or partial disclosure of
information in response to a request.

TC-TL-550a.2 Discussion of systems to provide unimpeded service during service interruptions
Verizon is an industry leader in operating resilient and reliable networks that support the needs of our customers. Our networks in the U.S. include various design elements, technologies and business
processes that work together to enhance the reliability of our services.
Designed with dual path and equipment redundancy. Verizon’s network design includes redundancy on critical paths and for critical network components to mitigate the impact of network events on
customers. We use forward-looking risk assessments to plan and maintain our fiber backhaul configuration for critical network sites. Such sites may contain traffic aggregation points, data centers or other
technical facilities and typically have fiber backhaul deployed in a resilient ring or hub configuration, as well as dual diverse entrance facilities supporting our core infrastructure. Verizon has also implemented
a “meshed” core network architecture, which enables network equipment to switch traffic almost instantly across multiple available transmission paths between two endpoints. When available, this enables the
network to self-recover promptly from outages to physical facilities (e.g., a fiber cut).
Use of battery and generator technology. To minimize the impact of power disruptions at critical sites, we deploy reserve power in the form of batteries and/or generators. Our switching facilities are
equipped with battery backup power and generators. Macro sites have battery backup power as well, and the majority are equipped with generators. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators
that can be deployed as needed.
Reliability-focused business processes. To minimize the likelihood of congestion on our networks, Verizon proactively manages and augments network capacity based on defined thresholds associated with
the expected voice, video, application and data traffic patterns across our network. To help ensure appropriate network diversity and redundancy, we perform several internal audits per year. Our engineering
standards for strategic directional platforms require high availability equipment with auto-failover capabilities to protect critical services. Requirements for diversity and redundancy for critical paths and
network sites are reviewed and addressed as part of network planning, engineering and operations activity.
Overlapping spectrum and coverage areas. Verizon designs its wireless network to provide for overlapping spectrum and coverage areas in many cases. If a particular cell site goes offline, devices may
switch to a different site and maintain connectivity. Different spectrum bands deployed on our 4G and 5G networks can provide customers with additional options for connectivity and capacity if certain bands
or nodes experience an increase in usage. Most customer devices have the option to move seamlessly between our 4G and 5G networks and available Wi-Fi networks to provide our customers with a high
degree of reliability.
For more information on how we manage business continuity risk and the measures we have undertaken to make our networks more resilient, see Network resilience and our latest TCFD Report.

3 Verizon was not required to file a Conflict Minerals Report in 2023 for the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022, because we did not manufacture or contract to manufacture products subject

5 Emissions calculated using the EPA Regional eGRID U.S. 2021 (Released January 2023).
6 To reflect the current state of technological advancements, in 2023, we eliminated dematerialization, the reduction in production of physical products such as newspapers, CDs and DVDs, as a contributor to our
model for measuring emissions avoided by Verizon’s products and services. Retaining dematerialization in the model would have resulted in approximately 20.9 million metric tons of CO₂e avoided through the use of
