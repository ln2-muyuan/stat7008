benefits of our environmental impact reduction projects in 2023 were not fully realized in that same year as several projects will not be completed until 2024
or later. Moreover, Hubbell’s business grew organically and through acquisitions in 2023. As a result, Hubbell did not experience notable progress toward our
goals when compared to our base year of 2022. As we continue to operationalize our ESG strategy across the company, we look forward to making progress

GENERAL DISCLOSURES
GRI 2: General 2-1 Organizational details Location of Hubbell Incorporated’s (NYSE: HUBB) headquarters: Shelton, Connecticut
Disclosures 2021 Our products are either sourced complete, manufactured, or assembled by subsidiaries in the United States (US), Canada, Puerto Rico,
Mexico, China, the United Kingdom (UK), Brazil, Australia, Spain, and Ireland. Hubbell also participates in joint ventures in Hong Kong and
the Philippines, and maintains offices in Singapore, Italy, China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Chile, and countries in the Middle East.

2-3 Reporting period, frequency and Unless otherwise noted, this sustainability report, as well as Hubbell's annual financial reporting, covers calendar year 2023 (January 1,
contact point 2023-December 31, 2023). Some initiatives or goals launched during early 2024 are also included in this report to provide up-to-date
information for our stakeholders. We intend to publish our sustainability report on an annual basis. This report was published in March
2024. For questions related to Hubbell's sustainability report or other ESG disclosures, please email sustainability@hubbell.com.
2-4 Restatements of information In order to better reflect the impact of Hubbell’s operations on the environment and society, Hubbell has internally evaluated and
refreshed our GRI disclosures. We decided to restate our historical and current year water data under GRI Disclosure 303-3 Water
Withdrawal since it more accurately represents the key progress indicator we are tracking: the total amount of water withdrawn from
water sources for use by Hubbell. We also decided to replace GRI Disclosure 306-3 with GRI Disclosures 306-4 and 306-5 because it
reflects the disaggregated waste metrics we are reporting, comprising waste diverted from disposal and waste directed to disposal by
waste type. In addition, we are reporting on new custom disclosures, including the total percentage of open positions filled by internal
candidates and the total number of third-party information security breaches, to expand upon the ESG-related key performance
indicators we previously tracked. Furthermore, we continued to enhance our emissions, water, waste, and recycling data measurement
and management processes in 2023. These activities led to an improvement in the completeness of our data inventories. As a result, we
restated our historical emissions, water, waste, and recycling data.
2-5 External assurance Hubbell engaged an external, third-party assurance provider to verify our Scope 1 and 2 location-based GHG emissions and water
withdrawal. Please refer to page 107 to view Hubbell's assurance statement (or visit Hubbell's 2023 assurance statement).

GRI 3: Material 3-3 Management of material topics For information on our approach to managing energy, GHG emissions, water, and waste, see GRI 3-3 for the material topic, "energy and
Topics 2021 emissions." As part of our commitment to enhance our environmental performance, we set water and waste goals to drive improvements
in our sustainability performance. These enterprise-wide goals include reducing water usage by 25% and reducing hazardous waste by
30% by 2030, compared to a 2022 baseline.
Our efforts to reduce our water usage include behavior changes that promote water conservation, identifying efficiency opportunities
to reduce water usage, and innovating opportunities to treat and reuse water throughout our facilities. As water availability and scarcity
varies considerably from region to region, we continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize the amount of water we consume on a
local basis. We are also focused on reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill from our operations, with a specific focus on hazardous
waste. Whenever feasible, we are dedicated to pursuing measures to reduce, recover, reuse, or recycle waste in our operations.

GRI 3: Material 3-3 Management of material topics From ideation to production, we are committed to developing best-in-class products that meet our customers’ business and sustainability
Topics 2021 objectives. Hubbell’s New Product Development (NPD) efforts are centered on developing solutions that enable our customers to solve
critical infrastructure problems. In addition to continuing to pursue NPD innovations in our existing product lines, Hubbell has recently
accelerated our efforts to invest in higher-value innovation opportunities across our portfolio. These investments are primarily focused
on key strategic growth verticals such as utility transmission and distribution infrastructure, utility distribution automation, electrical
transportation, renewables, data centers, and communications. Increasing our NPD investment in these verticals supports our strategy
to accelerate organic growth across clean energy megatrends in grid modernization and electrification. In addition, our NPD efforts are
conducted through a comprehensive stage-gate process, which includes a stage evaluating environmental performance.
No Applicable GRI Custom disclosure: Total sales Hubbell’s Products with Impact support the transition to an energy-efficient and low-carbon economy through four impact categories:
Topic Standard associated with Products with Impact
• Grid modernization and hardening: Equipping grid infrastructure with critical components to make it smarter and stronger.
• Resource efficiency: Innovating advanced solutions to operate the grid and critical infrastructure with greater efficiency.
• Renewable energy: Facilitating the generation, transmission, and distribution of clean energy to end consumers.
• Electrification: Enabling the grid to handle increased energy demands tied to the electrification of buildings, homes, and vehicles.
To define our four Products with Impact categories, we leveraged inputs from the European Union Taxonomy for Sustainable
Economic Activities, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and CDP definitions for products related to renewable energy,
energy efficiency, and a low-carbon economy. Our Products with Impact categories reflect the opportunity areas where we deliver the
largest positive impact for our customers and value chain.
Our Products with Impact represented approximately 65% of our total sales in 2023. This calculation includes all sales from electrical
utility transmission and distribution components and utility communications and controls, as well as products sold directly into solar
and wind applications. It also includes products that support grid modernization and communications applications such as 5G/fiber/
broadband access and data centers. This calculation excludes sales from products sold into oil and gas markets, which enhances the
safety of those applications. It also excludes sales from our broader portfolio of electrical products sold into various industrial, non-
residential, and residential applications.
Moreover, while our decarbonization-related products are salient to our business and our industry, we believe that our solutions also
generate positive social and environmental impacts beyond our Products with Impact categories. These benefits include enhancing
safety, resource efficiency, hardening of infrastructure, explosion prevention, and rural broadband access. For example, Hubbell Gas
Utility Solutions offers connectors and valves that both promote resource efficiency and prevent gas leaks and spills.

RT-EE-410a.3 Revenue from renewable energy- Hubbell’s Products with Impact support the transition to an energy efficient and low-carbon economy through four
related and energy efficiency-related impact categories:
products • G rid modernization and hardening: Equipping grid infrastructure with critical components to make it smarter and
stronger.
• R esource efficiency: Innovating advanced solutions to operate the grid and critical infrastructure with greater
efficiency.
• R enewable energy: Facilitating the generation, transmission, and distribution of clean energy to end consumers.
• E lectrification: Enabling the grid to handle increased energy demands tied to the electrification of buildings,
homes, and vehicles.
To define our four Products with Impact categories, we leveraged inputs from the European Union Taxonomy for
Sustainable Economic Activities, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and CDP definitions for products
related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and a low-carbon economy. Our Products with Impact categories
reflect the opportunity areas where we deliver the largest positive impact for our customers and value chain.
Our Products with Impact represented approximately 65% of our total sales in 2023. This calculation includes all sales
from electrical utility transmission and distribution components and utility communications and controls, as well as
products sold directly into solar and wind applications. It also includes products that support grid modernization
and communications applications such as 5G/fiber/broadband access and data centers. This calculation excludes
sales from products sold into oil and gas markets, which enhances the safety of those applications. It also excludes
sales from our broader portfolio of electrical products sold into various industrial, non-residential, and residential
applications.
Moreover, while our decarbonization-related products are salient to our business and our industry, we believe that
our solutions also generate positive social and environmental impacts beyond our Products with Impact categories.
These benefits include enhancing safety, resource efficiency, hardening of infrastructure, explosion prevention, and
rural broadband access. For example, Hubbell Gas Utility Solutions offers connectors and valves that both promote
resource efficiency and prevent gas leaks and spills.

critical materials Protection Act (the Act), aims to prevent the use of conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or
benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The Act requires our
company to perform due diligence with respect to the sourcing of conflict minerals and to report annually on
our potential use of conflict minerals and origin of such minerals. Our suppliers are responsible for following our
Conflict Minerals Policy and the conflict minerals guidelines in our Third-Party Code and for passing these same
requirements on to their suppliers.
We also screen and audit our suppliers both onsite and virtually to assess potential quality, financial, security,
social, and environmental issues or compliance risks, including risks related to the use of critical materials,
conflict minerals, or human rights violations.

demand from new and emerging markets as potential regulatory and market drivers continue to grow the renewable
energy market, which our products support (medium and long term).
b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks We recognize the impact that acute and transitional climate change can pose on our business. In response, we have
and opportunities on the organization’s implemented business continuity risk planning and emergency response plans to enable our business to mitigate
businesses, strategy, and financial planning the risk of business operations in our supply chain and protect our employees, facilities, and assets in the event of
extreme weather events. We have also integrated climate-related activities into our risk management processes.
Across Hubbell, teams monitor emerging schemes and regulations to ensure ongoing compliance; track acute
physical weather events to prepare for possible disruptions to product; and coordinate cross-functionally to manage
inventories, production process needs, and potential alternative product formulations as market conditions evolve in
our changing climate.
At the same time, we have put programs in place to capitalize on climate-related opportunities. We are committed
to improving our operational performance and, to guide these efforts, we set a GHG 2030 emissions target to reduce
our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared to a 2022 baseline. On an ongoing basis, we identify and pursue
opportunities for investing in energy efficiency and process improvements in our sites globally. For example, we
formalized the creation of our Sustainability Impact Program, which allocates capital to Hubbell facilities for projects
that enhance environmental performance and the efficiency of our business operations and processes. We have also
leveraged opportunities to engage with stakeholders to explore markets for environmentally preferable products,
such as those that enable energy efficiency, renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicles, and other low-
emissions technologies. To that end, Hubbell’s NPD team with the support of the sales team, regularly engages with
customers, performs sales forecasting, and executes market analysis to assess opportunities for products that help
our customers meet their business and sustainability objectives. Hubbell’s Products with Impact deliver products and
solutions that enable grid modernization and hardening, resource efficiency, renewable energy, and electrification.

overall risk management
As part of our risk management processes, Hubbell carefully monitors and evaluates the relevance of all policies,
laws, and regulations applicable to environmental protection, energy use, and emissions to ensure compliance.
Changes in regulation, such as energy efficiency legislation, regulations that limit GHG emissions, or disclosure
mandates (e.g., the forthcoming US SEC Climate Proposal), may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance,
operating, and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand. Violations of these laws could result in substantial
penalties or sanctions as well as restrictions of markets due to inability to comply/cost of redesign to comply.
Therefore, Hubbell assesses risks associated with both current and emerging regulations.
Moreover, Hubbell’s formal ERM program focuses on effectively identifying, prioritizing, and mitigating a wide range
of potential strategic and operational risks to the company, which may include climate-related risks (e.g., impacts
from climate change, such as storm, flood, and water implications). Hubbell's annual ERM assessment of enterprise
risks drives our process for determining the risks and opportunities that may have a substantive financial or strategic
impact on the company. We examine physical and transitional risks, which inform decisions related to mitigating,
transferring, accepting, or controlling identified risks, such as those related to climate change, and capitalizing on
opportunities. The risk management team refreshes the ERM risks on an ongoing basis to capture evolving and
emerging risks, which may include direct operational risks and risks outside of Hubbell’s operations in our supply
chain (both upstream and downstream) and in the market. In addition to identifying risks, the ERM also maps risks
to controls and risk owners and establishes risk mitigation plans which are then executed by the business. The ERM
process includes an annual survey of leaders from across the company to rank potential risks to the company. At
least once per year the ERM leaders brief the Board on risk management activities.

ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS – BASIS OF REPORTING
Guidance and Within this report, Hubbell Incorporated measures and discloses the company’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in accordance with the following guidance and standards:
Boundary • WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol
(2023)
• WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance
Organizational Boundary:
For Scope 1 and Scope 2 location-based GHG emissions, Hubbell selected an organizational boundary based on operational control. Therefore, only assets or facilities where our
business operates and can directly influence emissions-generating activities are included in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions calculations.
Restatements of Reported Data:
In 2023, we continued to enhance our energy and emissions data measurement and management processes. We also engaged with an external third-party assurance provider to
conduct limited assurance of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. These activities led to an improvement in the completeness of our inventory. As a result, we restated our historical energy and
emissions.
Acquisitions, Divestments, and Exclusions:
Hubbell established a recalculation threshold for significance of more than 5% of Hubbell’s total base-year inventory for the company’s rebaseline policy. Where an acquisition or
divestment is material, i.e., the inclusion or removal of the entity’s data results in a variation that exceeds ± 5% of the original, historical data will be restated where attainable. This may
include restating goal baselines where appropriate. We aim to fully integrate any acquired entities through our data collection, consolidation, and reporting processes within one full
fiscal quarter following the close date of an acquisition.
Hubbell acquired EIG in May 2023. The EIG acquisition did not trigger our rebaseline policy and therefore, EIG facilities within Hubbell’s operational control are included in our 2023
energy and emissions inventory.
In October 2023, Hubbell also closed a bolt-on acquisition of Balestro. Moreover, in December 2023, Hubbell closed an acquisition of Systems Control. Due to delays and current
limitations in accessing complete and accurate data for the new facilities included within those two acquisitions, all Balestro and Systems Control sites have been excluded from
Hubbell’s energy and emissions inventory. These facilities will be incorporated into Hubbell’s inventory from 2024 onward. Please see Hubbell’s 2023 Annual Report and 2024 Proxy
Statement filed with the US SEC for further details on Hubbell’s acquisitions.
In addition, the energy and emissions for consolidated joint ventures where Hubbell does not retain operational control have been excluded from our inventory.
Scope 1 GHG Scope 1 GHG emissions were measured in accordance with the WRI/ WBCSD GHG Protocol. Hubbell selected an organizational boundary based on operational control.

(2023) Data Sources:
Direct emissions sources include stationary and mobile combustion. Fuel sources included in Hubbell’s calculation of Scope 1 GHG emissions consist of natural gas, gasoline, diesel,
ethanol, heating oil, jet fuel, propane/liquified petroleum gas (LPG), and refrigerants dispensed. Hubbell obtains primary data from energy utility invoices, aviation reports, fuel receipts,
manufacturing site logs, and maintenance logs.
Estimates and Assumptions:
Where primary data is not available, the Hubbell team uses generally accepted estimation methods to calculate emissions and capture a complete and accurate population of data for
the reporting period. The following summarizes the estimation methodologies used by Hubbell for Scope 1:
• F or facility-level data gaps, Hubbell utilizes the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) energy intensity values and facility square footage or historic monthly
consumption values to estimate.
• F or LPG consumption estimations, Hubbell extrapolates data from historical LPG usage at our manufacturing facilities and warehouses, respectively, to create intensity factors that are
multiplied by the total number of months with missing data.
• F or fuel usage estimations, we refer to vehicle tank size and number of refuels.

include restating goal baselines where appropriate. We aim to fully integrate any acquired entities through our data collection, consolidation, and reporting processes within one full
fiscal quarter following the close date of an acquisition.
Hubbell acquired EIG in May 2023. The EIG acquisition did not trigger our rebaseline policy and therefore, EIG facilities within Hubbell’s operational control are included in our 2023
water inventory.
In October 2023, Hubbell also closed a bolt-on acquisition of Balestro. Moreover, in December 2023, Hubbell closed an acquisition of Systems Control. Due to delays and current
limitations in accessing complete and accurate data for the new facilities included within those two acquisitions, all Balestro and Systems Control sites have been excluded from
Hubbell’s water inventory. These facilities will be incorporated into Hubbell’s inventory from 2024 onward. Please see Hubbell’s 2023 Annual Report and 2024 Proxy Statement filed with
the US SEC for further details on Hubbell’s acquisitions.
In addition, the withdrawn water for consolidated joint ventures where Hubbell does not retain operational control has been excluded from our inventory. One small office within a multi-
tenant building in Italy has also been excluded from the inventory due to the minimal (immaterial) water use occurring at the site.
Water Water usage figures were measured by leveraging the GRI definition of water withdrawal. Hubbell selected an organizational boundary based on operational control. Direct water,
Withdrawal including groundwater (e.g., from wells) and third-party (i.e., municipal) water, are consolidated as total water withdrawn.

Data Sources:
Hubbell obtains primary data from water utility invoices and manufacturing site logs.
Estimates and Assumptions:
Where primary data is not available, the Hubbell team uses generally accepted estimation methods to calculate water withdrawal and capture a complete and accurate population of
data for the reporting period. The following summarizes the estimation methodologies used by Hubbell for withdrawn water:
• F or facility-level data gaps, Hubbell utilizes the CBECS water intensity values and facility square footage or historic monthly consumption values to estimate.
Water Hubbell calculates its water intensity figure by dividing the total withdrawn water per million dollars of total net sales. In 2023, Hubbell acquired EIG, Balestro, and Systems Control and
Intensity in the company’s financial filings for the 2023 fiscal year, those three acquisitions are included in Hubbell’s total net sales. Therefore, Hubbell’s water intensity calculation reflects this

WASTE AND RECYCLING – BASIS OF REPORTING
Guidance and Within this report, Hubbell Incorporated measures and discloses the company’s waste and recycling data in accordance with the following internal definitions:
Boundary • W aste directed to disposal encompasses any material produced as a by-product of business activities and operations that is not sold to our customers, but is intended or required to
(2023) be discarded and/or disposed of.
• R ecycling (i.e., waste diverted from disposal) encompasses the process of converting waste materials produced as a by-product of business activities and operations, and which would
otherwise be disposed of, into a new product or material.
• W aste and recycled waste subcategories were defined leveraging globally recognized and region-specific classifications of waste types.
• H azardous waste data represents waste deemed hazardous by region-specific definitions.
Organizational Boundary:
For waste and recycled waste, Hubbell selected an organizational boundary based on operational control. Therefore, only assets or facilities where our business operates and can
directly influence waste-generating and recycling activities are included in our waste and recycled waste inventories.
Restatements of Reported Data:
In 2023, we continued to enhance our waste and recycling data measurement and management processes. These activities led to an improvement in the quality and completeness of
our inventory. As a result, we restated our historical waste and recycling data.
Acquisitions, Divestments, and Exclusions:
Hubbell established a recalculation threshold for significance of more than 5% of Hubbell’s total base-year inventory for the company’s rebaseline policy for waste and recycled waste,
respectively. Where an acquisition or divestment is material, i.e., the inclusion or removal of the entity’s data results in a variation that exceeds ± 5% of the original, historical data will be

waste survey conducted with Hubbell’s facilities in 2023. The waste survey also led to the re-categorization of some of our recycled waste data based on inputs from our site contacts.
Moreover, Hubbell’s recycled zinc figures were disaggregated as a new recycled waste category for figures starting in 2022. Historical recycled zinc data was formerly captured within
the recycled industrial waste category.
