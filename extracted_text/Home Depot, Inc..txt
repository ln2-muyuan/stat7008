ESG TRANSPARENCY
This chart highlights The Home Depot’s key ESG metrics. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on many 2020 results. For example,
customer demand and supply chain volume rose substantially. In addition, we saw a decline in some materials collected from customers
through our in-store recycling programs. We also temporarily halted Team Depot community volunteer projects and associate fundraising
for The Homer Fund. Data from 2018 reflects the calendar year. Data for 2019 and 2020 reflects the fiscal year, except as otherwise
noted. For detailed diversity, equity and inclusion data, see pages 28-31.

Our diverse workforce of approximately 500,000 associates strengthens our competitive advantages and reflects the customers

diverse than the nation’s working population. These charts reflect the demographics of The Home Depot’s U.S. workforce from
2018 through 2020. Data sets from 2018 reflect the calendar year. Newer data reflects the fiscal year. Certain percentages may
not sum to totals due to rounding or some associates choosing not to self-identify by race/ethnicity or gender. Prior year data

PRACTICING DIVERSITY
EVERY DAY
Associate Christine Botnick got her start as a part-timer selling paint. Now she leads hundreds of supply chain
associates. Her career demonstrates that embracing diversity, equity and inclusion fuels success, and she is
committed to representing LGBTQ, women and minority associates climbing The Home Depot ladder.
hristine Botnick already had
C a full-time retail job when she
started working at Store 249 in
Oakland Park, Florida. But she
needed more money for rent, groceries and
college tuition.
She was 19, on her own and living
paycheck to paycheck, just as her parents
had always done. But Christine wanted
to do better. That’s why she was pursuing
a degree in psychology, on her way to
becoming the first person in her family to
graduate from college. And that’s why,
when her Home Depot manager suggested
she stretch beyond her part-time role in the
paint department, she listened. Christine
increased her hours, quit that other retail
job, and 18 months later became a paint
department supervisor.
“I just really felt, for the first time in my life,
that other people were interested in seeing
me succeed,” Christine recalls. “They saw
past my age and offered me an opportunity
and the means to build an income and a
better life for myself. They saw that I had
potential, even when I didn’t.”
That was 2003. By the end of 2006,
Christine was a 22-year-old assistant store
manager. In 2011, she became a district
services manager in South Florida. Three
years later, she was promoted to store
manager and ultimately led three Florida
stores, in Sunrise, Punta Gorda and Miami
Gardens. (Along the way, she earned that
college degree.)
Then, in 2020, as our company was facing
a huge surge in online orders, another

Aligning Work and Health Yields 40-Year Career
Associate Chris Owens’ Home Depot career began in 1981, after he showed up
repeatedly at an Atlanta store seeking work. As Chris describes it, he wore the manager
down and landed a job in lumber. He rose up the ranks, working in the aisles and driving
delivery and distribution trucks, until, in May 1992, he fell 60 feet while trimming trees
at his home. Chris broke his neck and was paralyzed from the collar bone down. Life had
to change.
After months in the hospital, where visits from fellow associates — including the
company’s founders — buoyed his spirits and resolve, Chris went to work in a
distribution center managing office operations and dispatch. He ultimately was
promoted to the Store Support Center team in a leadership role. But a person in a
wheelchair needs to keep moving, and the job involved long hours and too much sitting.
Chris developed a life-threatening skin wound. His doctor told him he had to work less
to preserve his health. Life had to change again.

Logistics Planner and Associate Since 1981, Chris changed course and brought his institutional knowledge, skills and relationships to

While he refuses to be defined by limitations, Chris believes it’s his responsibility to
represent other associates with disabilities and the benefits of adapting careers to
support inclusion. “I am living proof that you can do anything within The Home Depot
that you want to,” he says. “There’s something out there for you.”

Miracle needed to stay home to make sure Joel, who’s autistic, got the care and

the real concern was the well-being of my son,” she says. “I was not able to return

PROTECTION BY DESIGN
In a perfect example of ‘The Home Depot sprint,’ we brought together the right people and the right partners to
create long-lasting, good-looking shields to help protect front-line associates.
he mission was to reduce our
T front-line associates’ exposure
to COVID-19, and do it ASAP.
In nine days, our store design
team — first meeting virtually, then drafting
blueprints in an associate’s basement-
turned-workshop, and finally building
models after hours in a couple of Georgia
stores — created a plexiglass shield that
is now protecting thousands of our people
every day.
For associate Chad Thompson, a member
of our in-store environment team, the
assignment was both professional and
personal. He was determined to find
a sustainable, functional way to better
safeguard associates against the virus. One
of the associates he wanted to protect was
his daughter, Atley Thompson, who works
on the customer service desk at Store 1777
in Kennesaw, Georgia.
“It was mid-March 2020, and at that point,
nobody really knew for sure what the
coronavirus was and how it spread. But
if there was even a small chance that a
plexiglass shield could block those germs,
we needed to find a way to do it,” Chad

shields that would work in our stores.
The shields would need to withstand
run-ins with carts piled with heavy goods
like lumber. They had to improve safety,
not interfere with it. They needed to
allow accessibility and maneuverability
for associates and customers using
wheelchairs and other adaptive devices.
The shields also had to look like they
belonged in both our new and legacy stores
— not like slapdash plastic sheeting. And
the shields had to be easy to assemble,
using tools available in every store, so
associates could install them with speed,
preferably in a single shift.

Electricity Use
At the end of 2020, 1,589 of our U.S.
stores had been upgraded to overhead
LED lighting; LEDs were installed at 427
stores in 2020 alone.
Upgraded stores see electricity
consumption drop by about 30%,
on average, compared to using
conventional lighting. Plus, the stores
benefit from brighter aisles and better
control over their technology-enhanced
lights. For example, stores can
selectively dim some areas of the store
and leave others fully lit after hours,
when associates are restocking but
customers are not shopping.
LEDs have been a big investment for our
company, adding up to a $178 million
total capital expenditure from 2018 to
2020. But they’ve also been a big driver
of the remarkable electricity savings we
achieved in 2019 and 2020 (see chart).
And the progress continues. We’re on
track to install LEDs in all of our U.S.
stores by the end of fiscal 2021.

In 2020, our ongoing effort to find more sustainable substitutes for expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam led our packaging

takes up a lot of space, and it takes a long time to biodegrade. So, we made a big change to smaller, greener packages for
our private-label fans. Here’s how we did it.

Since 1989, The Home Depot has partnered with Habitat for Humanity to
revitalize neighborhoods across America through affordable homeownership
that helps build generational wealth. “Historic barriers to homeownership
are the foundation for the inequity and segregation we see in many
communities,” says Lisa Y. Gordon, president and CEO of Atlanta Habitat.
“More than 90% of our homebuyers are African American — 80% of
whom are women and the head of their household. The more we bring
attention to the issue, the closer we get to a more just society.”

MASK MISSION
As hospitals and first responders struggled to get crucial supplies, a small, cross-functional Home Depot team
orchestrated the donation of personal protective equipment to health care workers battling COVID-19.
110 The Home Depot 2021 ESG Report
THGILTOPS
n March 2020, The Home Depot
I accepted a mission to get
in-demand N95 masks to front-
line health care workers across
the United States. We ultimately donated 3.4
million masks to more than 250 hospitals
and health care facilities, drawing on our
associates’ ingenuity, expertise, strong
relationships and orange-blooded sheer will

Here’s how it began. In mid-March 2020, as
the COVID-19 coronavirus began sweeping
the globe and overwhelming hospitals, our
company started prioritizing mask sales to
health care facilities. Then, a few days later,
we ceased selling N95 masks and started
donating them to help protect front-line
nurses, doctors and first responders from
the virus.
That decision was important, bold and
complex. It was up to Jim Core, general

The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for action to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice and

Board Oversight of Risk
The company has a robust framework designed to identify and ensure proper management of risk, including risk relating
to our ability to operate responsibly and sustainably. The framework that we use to identify and manage risk considers a
number of enterprise-level issues, including competitive environment, brand and reputation, regulatory and compliance, and
security. The framework also considers external and internal factors that could distract from or derail strategic objectives. The
Board oversees risk through this framework, with oversight accomplished by identifying key risks and mapping them to the
appropriate Board committee or to the full Board.
Our Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the full Board or appropriate Board committees
discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year, including the COVID-19 pandemic, its related risks and its impact on
our enterprise risk framework. The table below identifies key risk areas overseen by the Board and its committees.
