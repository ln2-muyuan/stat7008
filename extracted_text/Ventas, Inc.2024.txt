About This Report
Ventas is committed to providing transparent and reliable reporting on our corporate environmental,
social and governance (ESG) strategy, goals and progress.
Unless otherwise noted, quantitative data in this report is as of December 31, 2023, and financial
information is presented in U.S. dollars. Our 2023-2024 Corporate Sustainability Report (CSR)
encompasses all Ventas corporate operations and our total owned real estate portfolio, unless otherwise
noted. It does not address the performance of our suppliers, contractors, operators or tenants, unless
otherwise noted.
This report is based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards sustainability reporting framework,
which is used to report an organization’s impacts on the economy, the environment and society. Ventas
has also incorporated disclosures aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD) framework and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Ventas obtains third-party assurance of certain ESG data and metrics, which can be found on our website.
Historical, current and forward-looking statements may be based on standards for measuring progress
that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and assumptions that
are inherently uncertain. Further, forward-looking statements relating to Ventas’s operations are based
on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections; see the “Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” on Page 96. The information contained in this report is provided as of the
date of this report and is subject to change. Ventas does not undertake to update or revise any such
statements. In this report, we do not use the terms “material” and “materiality” as defined and interpreted
by the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Instead, the terms
refer to issues that are of significant importance to our stakeholders and to Ventas. These “material”
issues inform our corporate ESG strategy, goals and initiatives.
Website references and hyperlinks throughout this report are provided for convenience only, and the
content on the referenced websites is not incorporated by reference into this report or constitute a part

Portfolio Overview
STEP FUNCTION GROWTH IN THE 80+ POPULATION
For more than 25 years, Ventas has pursued what we believe is a successful, enduring strategy focused on delivering
outsized value to shareholders and other stakeholders. Working with industry-leading care providers, partners,
developers and research and medical institutions, our collaborative and experienced team is focused on achieving
consistent, superior total returns through (1) delivering profitable organic growth in senior housing, (2) capturing
value-creating external growth focused on senior housing, (3) driving strong execution and cash flow generation
throughout our portfolio of high-quality assets unified in serving the large and growing aging population and (4)
maintaining financial strength, flexibility and liquidity.
An Essential Role in the Longevity Economy
The aging of America’s population – including more than 70 million baby boomers – drives unprecedented
demand for senior housing, outpatient medical visits and healthcare research & development. Ventas properties
are at the center of these portions of the economy, serving a large and growing aging population.

HOW DOES VENTAS BENEFIT AN AGING POPULATION?
Ventas provides exceptional senior living environments where residents enjoy the benefits of care and
community in a supported setting. Research verifies that older adults live longer and healthier in senior
communities (see Page 45). In addition, our outpatient medical properties provide convenient access to quality
healthcare, and our research facilities help enable lifesaving discoveries and medical advances that are of
growing importance as the population ages.

Biodiversity Impacts
• Investing in public spaces, community gathering areas and infrastructure upgrades
We primarily acquire existing properties in urban and suburban locations, and most of our development is
brownfield redevelopment or urban infill, which revitalizes communities. Biodiversity has not been a high-impact,
material topic for Ventas, although we support biodiversity efforts where appropriate. When considering an
acquisition, we obtain Phase I reports to understand environmental impacts and exposures. Our existing buildings
and developments are typically not near sensitive habitats or ecosystems, but in the limited circumstances where
we have encountered such areas, we take care to limit and mitigate impacts from our activities.

REFLECTING LOCAL HISTORY IN PROJECT DESIGN
The Charlotte project integrates important local historical elements into its design. In the
late 1940s, the Myers Street School, known as The Jacob’s Ladder School due to its fire-
escape ladders, was the state’s largest elementary school for Black children. Although
the school was lost during urban renewal, its iconic staircase remains a symbol of
educational progress.
The campus design includes a Jacob’s Ladder at its center, honoring this legacy.
In addition, a landscaped “Purposeful Walk” path will include history-inspired
murals by local artists and informational stops where walkers can learn about
the area’s history.

Enhancing Our Workplace Experience
A world-class office environment for collaboration and engagement is essential to our talent strategy and,
in 2024, we will be moving to our new Chicago headquarters. With meaningful input from our people –
through surveys, focus groups, site visits and furniture fairs – the new space has been designed to prioritize
collaboration, productivity and the well-being of Ventas employees. All employees will have workspaces
with standing desks and right-to-light features to enhance comfort and effectiveness in the office.
DESIGNING OUR NEW HQ: AN EMPLOYEE-CENTRIC APPROACH
Every space and aspect of our new corporate headquarters has been
designed with a clear priority: providing an outstanding experience
for our employees. Throughout the design process, we have solicited
and incorporated employee feedback to deliver a space that
engages our employees, inspires them to do their best work and
supports their individual well-being.

Cybersecurity &
Data Privacy
Ventas considers cybersecurity risk a serious threat to our assets and our
people and has established practices to mitigate the risk and impact of
any disruption. Ventas takes a cross-functional approach to mitigating
cybersecurity risk involving all departments within the Company in
addition to third-party experts who validate our practices and share best
practices from other companies.
Management briefs the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board
at least once a year on information security controls, protocols and risk
assessment with mitigation measures. At the management level, we
regularly identify and assess information security risks using industry
practices aligned to recommendations from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology and engage independent security firms to
conduct periodic penetration tests to identify and remediate potential
vulnerabilities. We also work with internal and external business partners
to assess information security risks within their organizations that could
impact Ventas. We engage with a third-party Security Operations Center
to monitor and respond to threats 24/7.
CYBERSECURITY TRAINING
We provide employees with the training, tools and resources to protect
themselves and the Company from information security breaches and
to identify and report potential threats. Employees receive training
and testing on cybersecurity protocols throughout the year, including
monthly anti-phishing campaigns; semi-annual cyber lunch-and-learn
programs; and mandatory annual training and assessments with passing
requirements. The Ventas Employee Handbook includes policies on
how employees are to manage and use Company electronic systems. All
employees acknowledge that they have read, understood and will abide
by the company’s information security policy.
DATA PRIVACY
Ventas prioritizes safeguarding the data of its job candidates,
employees, partners, clients, tenants and other stakeholders. 100%
We minimize the amount of private information collected to support
business needs and use secure storage and transfer protocols
leveraging advanced encryption of critical information.
