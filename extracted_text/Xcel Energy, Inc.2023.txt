Who We Are
Xcel Energy is committed to delivering essential energy to our customers — energy that’s reliable, safe,
affordable and clean — while driving positive change for people and planet. That’s what we call going
beyond energy.
We were the first major U.S. power company with a vision for providing 100% carbon-free electricity —
and we’ve expanded on that commitment to become the first in our industry with comprehensive goals to
reach net-zero emissions across the most significant ways customers use energy — electricity, natural gas
use in buildings and transportation.
Based in Minneapolis, Xcel Energy Northern States Power Co.–Minnesota
powers millions of homes and
businesses with electricity and natural
gas across parts of eight Western
and Midwestern states through four
regulated operating companies. Northern States Power Co.–Wisconsin

CEO Message
In 2023, we marked the five-year anniversary of our clean energy commitment: a
bold, industry-leading vision to deliver 100% carbon-free electricity to customers
by 2050. When we made this commitment, it was a watershed moment for our
industry as we joined environmental advocates, customers and policymakers to
chart a path to a clean energy future. Today, 40 U.S. utilities have followed suit with
their own carbon reduction goals.
We’re well on our way to achieving our aggressive goal of an 80% carbon reduction
and fully exiting coal by the end of 2030. Plus, our clean energy commitment has
expanded to include goals that cover the most significant ways our customers use
energy, including natural gas services and transportation.
At its core, our vision is about sustainability, energy security and economic
prosperity. We’re committed to delivering the essential energy services our
customers expect and need while continuing to drive positive change that supports
the environment. This commitment includes reaching net zero responsibly and
affordably, operating with integrity, strengthening the communities we serve and
cultivating a diverse, best-in-class workforce to deliver on our vision. In 2023, we:
• Laid the groundwork to extend the lives of our two nuclear plants, Monticello
and Prairie Island, which are the largest sources of clean energy that serve
our customers.
• Retired our first of three units at our Sherburne County Generating Station
on December 31 while simultaneously building the largest solar facility in the
Midwest at the same site.
• Broke ground on Colorado’s Power Pathway, a $1.7 billion transmission
superhighway across the Eastern Plains of Colorado — and just one of the
major transmission projects we have underway that will deliver clean energy
to our customers.
• Received a nearly $1.5 billion grant from the Department of Energy to support
our Heartland Hydrogen Hub, long-term duration storage pilots with Form
Energy, transmission expansion and grid resilience in extreme weather. These
technologies will be key to achieving our long-term zero-carbon goals while
helping to keep our customers' bills low.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 5
• Increased female representation among senior leaders (vice presidents
and above).
• Granted $4.4 million to 409 nonprofits through our foundation’s focus
area grants.
• Volunteered 93,000 hours, with our employees and retirees making a
$2.9 million economic impact through volunteering.
• Used 63% of our supply chain spend locally, with $1.3 billion spent with
small and diverse suppliers.
• Provided $187 million in energy and affordability assistance to 188,000 families.
Through 2023, we reduced carbon emissions from generation serving customers by
an estimated 54% from 2005 levels. In addition, we have significantly reduced other
emissions and environmental impacts, including water, mercury and nitrogen oxides.
I’m also proud to share our residential customers' electric bills are amongst the
lowest in the country, at 28% below the national average. In addition, the actions
we've taken over the past seven years to install thousands of megawatts of wind
energy have provided nearly $4 billion in customer price mitigation through avoided
fuel costs and production tax credits.
I’m incredibly pleased with the progress we are making across our sustainability
initiatives and the commitment and hard work of our people to help deliver a clean
energy future. We will remain relentless in pursuit of our vision and will continue to
deliver long-term value to our shareholders and the essential clean energy power
needs for the communities in which we live and work.
Thank you for your ongoing support and partnership.
Sincerely,
Bob Frenzel
Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer

Carbon-Free Electricity
Using technology available today, like wind, solar, nuclear and battery technologies, our resource plans
establish a trajectory to achieve our goal of 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. To achieve
our long-term aspiration to deliver carbon-free electricity by 2050, we will need innovation and new
dispatchable technologies to maintain system reliability. Through collaborations with industry partners,
researchers, technology developers and venture investors, we’re engaged in advancing affordable, zero-
carbon, 24/7 power technologies.
Progress Toward Carbon-Free Electricity
Through 2023, we reduced carbon emissions from generation serving customers by an estimated 54% from
2005 levels and remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction and fully exit coal by the end of 2030.
Our clean energy vision includes all the electricity that serves our customers, including owned and
purchased power. These charts show our energy mix and carbon dioxide emissions (short tons),
companywide and by operating company, compared to the 2005 baseline.

Colorado Clean Energy Plan
We submitted plans to the Colorado PUC to achieve 80% carbon emissions reductions and Colorado’s goal
to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. Our first Clean Energy Plan, which adds solar and wind
resources, was approved by the PUC in 2023. We anticipate beginning Phase II of the Clean Energy Plan
through the Just Transition Solicitation to be filed later in 2024. We expect that request conclusion in 2026.
Current expectations of known or requested changes indicate we will likely add the following resources
through 2028:
• 2,050 megawatts of wind and 1,720 megawatts of large-scale solar capacity.
• 1,200 megawatts of distributed solar capacity.
• 450 megawatts of dispatchable resources and 1,850 megawatts battery storage.
We will work with impacted communities as we phase down all remaining Colorado coal operations, including:
• Comanche Station Unit 3 retirement by the end of 2030, with reduced operations beginning in 2025.
• Pawnee Station conversion from coal to natural gas by 2026.
• Hayden Station and Craig Station Unit 2 retirement by the end of 2028.
Upper Midwest Energy Plans (Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan)
In February 2024, we proposed a new Upper Midwest Energy Plan that builds on our already-approved
plans to retire our coal plants by 2030 and replace them with renewable energy. This updated plan not only
helps us achieve our 2030 goal but also demonstrates us a pathway to achieve Minnesota’s carbon-free
electricity standard of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The plan will:
• Add 5,800 megawatts of wind, 1,500 megawatts of large-scale solar and 1,320 megawatts of
energy storage by 2035.
• Retire all remaining coal plants by 2030.

Carbon dioxide emissions are from electricity delivered to customers in 2023 and are considered preliminary until
third-party verified in early 2025. Energy mix includes electricity produced at Xcel Energy plants, purchased from
others and supplied to customers through Xcel Energy renewable energy choice programs.
• Extend the generation of carbon-free nuclear energy at our Monticello plant 10 years to 2050 and our
Prairie Island plant 20 years to 2053/2054.
• Build upon current energy efficiency programs and create new demand response options to manage
energy load.
• Develop new transmission infrastructure, reusing important connections near retiring coal plants to
help maintain reliability.
We also need 1,500 megawatts of firm dispatchable generation by 2028, including hydrogen-ready
capacity. Nearly all that new capacity will require additional regulatory approval and we expect to need
more capacity in 2030 and beyond.
Southwest Energy Plans
We have proposed new electricity plans with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission and the
PUC of Texas. Our plans include:
• Converting the Harrington coal plant to operate on natural gas in 2024 and cessation of coal
operations at Tolk Station, located about 70 miles northwest of Lubbock, Texas, by the end of 2028.
• After evaluating projects submitted through an all-source, competitive solicitation issued in 2022, we
have proposed three company-owned solar projects with a combined capacity of 418 megawatts
and a 36-megawatt battery energy storage project.
• We are proposing a new purchased power agreement for a new 48-megawatt battery energy
storage project and a new 15-year purchased power agreement for an existing cogeneration facility.
If approved by regulators, the new facilities could be in service between 2026 and 2027.
Additional resources for the region beyond 2027 will be scoped through an all-source, competitive
solicitation to be issued in mid-2024. For information on how we’re advancing new, innovative clean energy
technologies needed to achieve our 2050 vision, see our Renewable Energy and Innovation brief.
Net-Zero Natural Gas
We’re working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the entire natural gas value chain. By 2050,
we aim to provide natural gas service with net-zero emissions while achieving our 2030 interim goal of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas service by 25% from 2020 levels, including net-zero
methane emissions from our own infrastructure.
Our goal covers all three aspects of the natural gas value chain: upstream production, the LDC distribution
system and customer emissions. By 2030, we plan to purchase 100% certified natural gas (CNG) on our
system and have net-zero methane emissions on our owned system while decreasing overall emissions by
25%, including our customer’s emissions. All three support the 2050 goal of achieving net-zero emissions
across our gas service.

hydrogen and renewable natural gas (RNG).
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 12
The natural gas side of the business is earlier in the transition than the electric sector and will require
significant market and policy changes to achieve. We have set a very ambitious vision with exactly that
long-term change in mind.
While we seek to achieve these reductions, we cannot sacrifice reliability and affordability for our
customers, particularly as natural gas provides critical heating in our cold climates. To be successful, we
will need to see significant customer action, regulatory approval of our clean heat plans and investments
in these emissions reductions efforts along with development of additional supportive state policies and
significant technology innovation. And we can't do this alone. We need new and deep partnerships across
the energy sector, government agencies, customers, environmental partners and other stakeholders.
These are fundamental elements needed to achieve our goal.
Net-Zero Methane Emissions from Distribution
Even though methane emissions on our gas system are relatively small (~200,000 tons carbon equivalent),
we are prioritizing achieving net-zero methane on our system in order to align with national and international
targets to address methane and emissions under our direct ownership control on an accelerated timeline.
We’ve already started efforts to reduce methane emissions on our LDC system and are seeking to expand
these efforts by deploying new technologies, such as advanced mobile leak detection.
In 2008, we joined the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Natural Gas Star program to voluntarily
reduce methane emissions. In 2016, we became a founding member of the Methane Challenge
Partnership. Through this, we have reduced methane emissions from venting pipelines during scheduled
construction projects by an average on 93% over the past five years.
Our methane reduction goal initiatives include:
• Seeking regulatory approval and exploring the use of advanced mobile or aerial leak detection
technologies for surveying our system to supplement our annual compliance inspections.
• Accelerating efforts to find and fix methane leaks.
• Reducing methane emissions on construction projects. We've reduced emissions of natural gas
from pipelines on transmission projects by lowering purge pressures, using hot taps to minimize
purge volumes, using flaring rather than venting and replacing gas-actuated pneumatic devices
with air-actuated devices. We are also expanding these practices to include our distribution
construction projects.
We belong to industry collaborations, including Our Nation’s Energy Future, a partnership that seeks to limit
methane emissions across the natural gas supply chain to 1% or less by 2025. We report emissions in the
Processing, Transmission and Storage, and Distribution segments of the value chain. In 2022 and 2023, we
surpassed specific goals for each of these segments.
The Natural Gas Sustainability Initiative (NGSI), sponsored by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and
American Gas Association (AGA), focuses on creating consistent, transparent disclosures among natural
gas providers. We use the NGSI reporting protocols to calculate methane emissions from our natural gas
distribution operations. Find results of our methane emissions calculations using the NGSI protocol in the
Sustainability Report Data Summary.
Natural Gas with Certified Low-Methane Emissions
Our natural gas net-zero vision prioritizes methane emissions reduction from upstream production of
natural gas. As part of our interim 2030 commitment, we strive to purchase only certified low-emission
natural gas from suppliers. Addressing methane from upstream will require partnership with our suppliers,
given we do not have direct control over upstream methane emissions. However, it is important we play a
part in addressing methane emission across the value chain in line with national and international climate
targets.
We are also working with suppliers to deploy industry best practices for monitoring, tracking and
reducing of wellhead-related emissions. In 2023, we worked with coalitions, such as the Differentiated
Gas Coordination Council, to develop federal certified emissions standards and accounting principles to
increase transparency and verification. We have worked with upstream producers to advance the certified
natural gas market and enhance verification methodologies, explored market supply through requests
for information and continued to monitor state policy developments that can support methane emissions
reductions.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 13
Cost-Effective Customer Options for Lower Carbon Emissions
As of 2022, about 75% of our customers heated their homes and businesses reliably with natural gas.
While our system continues to grow as we deliver to new customers, individual customers have reduced
their gas use more than 20% since 2000 through more efficient appliances, better building practices and
our extensive portfolio of conservation programs.
We support customer choice, offering voluntary options for customers to choose solutions that work
best for them. We are expanding our offerings for electric air source heat pump technologies, including
dual fuel options with natural gas backup for really cold days and new energy sources, such as heating
networks, which connect homes and businesses through a system of ground-source heat pumps. We also
see the need for additional options fuels like hydrogen and RNG that can ensure reliability and emissions
reductions, including through voluntary programs.
A major unknown in the transition is the extent of customer adoption of these voluntary programs. To the
extent that customer adoption does not arise or is slower than expected, additional emissions reductions
measures like clean fuels and offsets can ensure continued progress towards emissions reductions while
also delivering reliability support in our cold climates. These resources can deliver emissions reductions
without a customer taking action.
In the case of offsets, we view these projects as an addition to our work directly with customers. We’re
committed to investing in high-quality offset projects that can be verified to reduce emissions and provide
economic, environmental and equity “co-benefits” in our communities. We have purchased offsets from
six local projects to gain experience and build the local market. Examples include conserving wildlife
habitat, increasing tree cover in disadvantages areas, supporting Tribal sovereignty and land management,
and promoting local economic development. Learn more in our Biodiversity and Land Use brief.
Clean Heat, Gas Infrastructure and Natural Gas Innovation Act Plans
In 2023, we filed plans in Colorado and Minnesota in compliance with Colorado’s Clean Heat Statute and
Minnesota’s Natural Gas Innovation Act (NGIA). Both were initiated by legislation in 2021 and provide a
pathway for recovering important investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while considering
ways to help keep customer bills low.
Colorado Clean Heat Plan: a comprehensive, groundbreaking plan to determine a pathway to achieve
state greenhouse gas emission reduction goals related to the gas local distribution company while
considering costs to customers.
In 2023, we proposed an inaugural plan to the Colorado PUC including direct compliance portfolios, a set of
market transformation initiatives to advance technology options and voluntary measures for CNG and RNG.
Based on these proposals, we anticipate the PUC to approve a project budget advancing electrification and
recovered methane, along with a portfolio of market transformation initiatives.
Colorado Gas Infrastructure Plan: In spring 2023, we submitted our first-ever Gas Infrastructure Plan
in Colorado, which is a complement to the Clean Heat Plan. It details the investment projects critical to
continuing to provide customers with reliable, safe natural gas service. Additionally, the plan included five
nonpipeline alternative analyses to identify programs, equipment or actions that may avoid, reduce or delay
capacity expansion investment projects within the plan period. Two of the nonpipeline alternative portfolios
were determined to be cost effective as compared to the traditional gas infrastructure project, and the
Colorado PUC directed us to proceed in its decision in March 2024.
Minnesota NGIA Plan: offers a portfolio of innovative pilot projects across a broad array of technologies
that, if scaled up in the future, have the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions from our natural
gas system. Benefits include:
• Capturing and using RNG generated from landfills, food and livestock waste.
• A hydrogen project to create steam for industrial use, utilizing renewable energy from solar or wind
facilities to produce clean hydrogen.
• Strategic electrification, including custom projects with energy modeling for large customers.
• A weatherization and strategic electrification program for Tribal housing at Prairie Island Indian
Community that includes manufactured homes.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 14
The plans will be decided through state PUCs and will include stakeholder input, like our electric resource
plans. We anticipate regulators to decide on the Clean Heat Plan later in 2024 and the NGIA Plan in
early 2025.
Progress Toward Net-Zero Natural Gas
In 2023, we finalized our corporate protocol to report our progress toward reducing greenhouse gas
emissions from the natural gas business compared to a 2020 baseline. We expect greenhouse gas levels
from our natural gas business will increase over the next several years due to system growth while we
launch initiatives for lowering them.
Our 2023 emissions are calculated using different protocols than we have reported in the past. Current
methodologies include:
• Methane emissions from upstream suppliers are estimated using 1% average production intensity.
• Methane emissions from our natural gas system operations are based on NGSI reporting protocols
that include natural gas delivered to customers (throughput) normalized to reflect typical weather
conditions. The reporting uses emissions factors from the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory Program
for pipeline mains and service connections.
• Carbon dioxide emissions from customer end-use of natural gas is calculated based on the EPA’s
reporting protocol in 40 CFR Part 98, Subpart NN and multiplied by total actual throughput.
To comply with state reporting requirements, we will follow the required state protocols. For the Colorado
Clean Heat Plan, we are required to report LDC operations emissions using EPA Subpart W and customer
emissions using Subpart NN. For the Minnesota NGIA Plan, we are not required to report emissions, but
for emissions projections within the filing, we will use GREET lifecycle analysis emission factors.

Climate Science Supports Our Vision
We use climate science to inform our clean energy strategy. We contracted with a lead author for
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and his team of climate modeling experts to
understand how our carbon-free electricity and net-zero gas goals would align with global temperature
goals. The studies determined that our plans to limit carbon from electric generation and natural gas
use in buildings are consistent with scenarios that achieve the 1.5° and 2° C warming goals of the Paris
Agreement.
Analyzing the Path to 100% Carbon-Free Electricity
We contracted with climate modeling experts to understand how our vision relates to global temperature
goals — specifically delivering 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and reducing carbon emissions 80%
by 2030. These experts consulted the newest IPCC emission scenarios database and analyzed carbon
emissions for the electric sector in industrialized countries within global greenhouse gas scenarios that
have a high (66% or greater) probability of achieving the 2° C goal and those more likely than not (50% or
greater) to achieve the 1.5° C goal.
Our carbon emissions reduction trajectory to 2050 was then compared with the IPCC emissions scenarios
(shaded gray in the chart below). Based on this analysis, our reduction targets are clearly consistent with —
even on the low end of — the electric sector reductions in scenarios that achieve the international
1.5° C goal.

Study results show a range of possible outcomes that all achieve the same climate goals for natural gas in a
low-carbon future driven by the cost and availability of technology, especially in colder climates that rely the
most on natural gas for heating. Our strategy is consistent with and can help drive these outcomes. Over
the next decade, our voluntary strategy for achieving net-zero natural gas service can achieve the same
range of emission reductions as the scenarios in the study do.
Transportation Electrification
Our transportation programs in four states aim to make the transition to electric transportation easier for
our customers. We have an ambitious vision to enable zero-carbon transportation in our service area by
2050, providing the fueling infrastructure and energy to run all vehicles on carbon-free electricity or other
clean energy sources.
In 2023, we counted over 143,000 electric vehicles (EVs) on the road in our service area, a 50% increase
over 2022. By 2030, we plan to provide programs and infrastructure that deliver affordable charging at
home, at work and on the go to all our customers as part of our plan to boost EV growth in our states to one
in five vehicles.

Fleet Electrification
We continue to work toward a cost-effective transition of our corporate fleet to zero-carbon transportation.
In 2023:
• We added 40 zero-emission vehicles and construction equipment, bringing our electrified fleet to
nearly 300 vehicles. 11% of our light-duty fleet, 4% of our medium-duty fleet and 1% of our heavy-
duty fleet is now electrified.
• Our electric fleet drove over 1.3 million miles.
• We launched two pilots to demonstrate the electrification opportunities in the medium/heavy-duty
vehicle and construction equipment fleet segments.
• Six electric power take-offs, or ePTOs, were deployed. These units eliminate idling and noise
pollution while powering aerials needed to service overhead powerlines.
• We added two all-electric mini excavators to our construction operations. Xcel Energy is one of the
first utilities to pilot fully electric equipment in this sector.
• We activated 97 charging stations at Xcel Energy sites to support EV deployment. The chargers
dispensed nearly 19,700 MWh of energy, avoiding nearly 3,600 gallons of fuel and translating to
$18,000 in savings at the pump.
• To broaden our charging strategy, we launched a residential charging pilot involving 22 drivers across
our eight-state territory. Data indicates a significant increase in charging activity, increased BEV
utilization and positive operator feedback. We expect this pilot to expand into a program later in the
decade and contribute to our overall EV charging strategy.
Customer Programs
We have offered customer EV solutions since 2015, increasing our offerings each year while addressing
common barriers to adoption through education, rebates and incentives. Affordable transportation
electrification offerings, including EV charging programs, rebates, installation and maintenance services,
and advisory services are accessible to customers across Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico and
Wisconsin.
Under our clean energy plans, an EV powered with Xcel Energy electricity in 2023 has about 65% lower
carbon emissions than a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle and is expected to have at least 80%
lower carbon emissions by 2030. In addition to the environmental benefits, EVs are less expensive to drive,
costing about the equivalent of $1 per gallon of gasoline when charged during off-peak rate periods.
Equitable EV access and environmental justice are key components of our electric transportation
vision, which would allow everyone in the communities we serve to experience the benefits of electric
transportation, whether they own an EV, use public transit or benefit from improved air quality.
By 2050, our goal is for all customers to access affordable charging at or within one mile of their homes
and that underserved communities will have opportunities to participate in our programs and the economic
development benefits associated with zero-carbon transportation.
Getting a Burger and a Boost
As part of its commitment to sustainability, Breckenridge Brewery in Littleton, Colorado, recently installed
three Level 2 dual-port EV charging stations that employees can use for free; patrons can use them for a
dollar or two an hour while they enjoy a beer and a bite.
Saving energy, reducing water use and using renewables are all part of Breckenridge Brewery's
sustainability plan. That’s why its team turned to Xcel Energy to collaborate. “We wanted to offer free
charging to our employees and thought our guests would enjoy it, too,” said Hannah Kight, senior manager
of environment and safety at Breckenridge Brewery. “We knew Xcel Energy provided credits for EV
charging stations and that we could also apply for grant money through Charge Ahead Colorado.”
Breckenridge Brewery chose the full-service
option, where Xcel Energy installs the supply
infrastructure and offers chargers for a monthly
fee with the option to own them in 10 years. The
service includes no-cost to low-cost, turnkey
construction services for the infrastructure
and design and build-out guidance. Additional
financial benefits include lower upfront costs
for Xcel Energy-provided chargers and taking
advantage of low-cost, off-peak pricing. One of
the brewery's employees made the choice to
buy an EV knowing they could charge it at work.
“[This partnership] supports our sustainability
goals to make sure our footprint is as small as
it can be,” Kight said. “And it’s also just really
cool.”
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 18
Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Tracking and Reporting
We publicly report greenhouse gas emissions to track progress toward our goals for electricity and natural
gas and annually verify and publicly disclose greenhouse gas emissions through The Climate Registry
(TCR) for our electric and owned natural gas system emissions. Our reporting is based on TCR's General
Reporting Protocol and Electric Power Sector Protocol, which aligns with World Resources Institute and
ISO 14000 series standards. In 2007, we joined TCR as a founding member to help establish a consistent
standard for calculation, third-party verification and reporting, and have since verified our reporting
following TCR's standards back to 2005. We are the only energy provider with consecutively verified data
back to 2005, a baseline commonly used by standards bodies as well.
Our goals cover scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. We report progress toward our carbon reduction goals (80%
by 2030 and 100% by 2050) based on carbon dioxide emissions associated with the electricity we deliver
to customers. When we have more electricity than we need, we sell into wholesale markets. Because
the energy from those sales does not serve our customers, we exclude those carbon emissions from our
reporting. If the purchasers of that energy follow accepted protocols, they will include those emissions in
their reporting.
We are currently working to expand our greenhouse gas reporting to accurately track progress in meeting
our net-zero vision for the natural gas business, which includes both methane and carbon dioxide from the
supply, delivery and customer use of natural gas.

Wind Repowering and Development Projects
As our power purchase agreements expire over the next decade, we continue to seek opportunities to buy
and repower older wind farms. We have acquired two such projects in Minnesota: the 20-megawatt Rock
Aetna project, completed in December 2022, and the 100-megawatt Northern Wind project, completed in
January 2023.
We’re also upgrading turbine components, including blades, at four company-owned wind farms. Upon
completion, we expect the average annual energy output of the farms to increase approximately 20%
compared to previous levels. The projects include:
• 200-megawatt Nobles Wind Farm (repowering completed 2022).
• 100.5-megawatt Ben Fowke Wind Energy Center (repowering completed 2023).
• 150-megawatt Border Winds Wind Farm (estimated completion 2025).
• 200-megawatt Pleasant Valley Wind Farm (estimated completion 2025).
The repowering projects are projected to save customers approximately $160 million in energy costs
over the next 25 years and create up to 700 temporary union construction jobs in addition to indirect jobs
provided by suppliers. They will also provide landowners and local governments more than $9 million in
annual lease and property tax payments.
In addition to our repowering projects, our recently filed 2024-2040 Upper Midwest Energy Plan calls
for the development of a significant amount of wind projects, including wind projects through purchase
power agreements and owned by Xcel Energy interconnected to the Minnesota Energy Connection for us
to reuse interconnection rights with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), MISO, an
independent, not-for-profit, member-based organization focused on managing the flow of high-voltage
electricity across 15 states and Manitoba, Canada.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 22
Expanding our Portfolio of Large-Scale Solar Projects and Storage
Currently, all large-scale utility solar power on our system is contracted through power purchase
agreements. However, this is starting to change.
Upper Midwest
We will own three separate solar projects at the site of the retiring Sherburne County (Sherco) Generating
Station and compete to build new solar projects in our Colorado and Minnesota resource plans approved
in 2022. Minnesota regulators approved two solar phases in 2022, replacing most of the capacity from
the first coal unit retiring at the Sherco plant in 2023. The third phase, proposed in 2023, would add 250
megawatts and bring the complex to a total of 710 megawatts — enough to power 150,000 Minnesota
homes with energy fueled by the sun to keep bills low.
The first solar panel modules arrived in January 2024, and deliveries will continue through September 2024.
The first phase of the Sherco Solar project is forecasted to be in service in October 2024, and the second
phase is forecasted to be in service in October 2025. The third phase of the Sherco Solar project is currently
being evaluated for site permit approval by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC). Sherco Solar
is expected to provide $350 million in local benefits, including landowner payments, state and local property
taxes, and production taxes over its 35-year life. Xcel Energy will build, own and operate the project. When
completed in 2026, Sherco Solar will be the fifth-largest solar facility in the country, with 1.8 million solar
panels covering 4,500 acres across the three sites.
We will purchase power from the 100-megawatt Apple River Solar project for our Upper Midwest system,
as well as from the Fillmore County and Louise solar projects. Located in Polk County, Wisconsin, the
Apple River project will be one of the largest solar installations in the state and is expected to come online
at the end of 2025.
Many, if not all, solar resources interconnecting to the King gen-tie and Minnesota Energy Connection
will be owned by Xcel Energy so we can reuse interconnection rights with MISO at the sites of retiring
coal generation.
Colorado
Our 2018 Colorado Energy Plan called for the purchase of nearly 775 megawatts of solar power and
225 megawatts of storage. The 200-megawatt Sun Mountain Solar project in Pueblo County began
operating in December 2022. The Neptune Solar Energy Center in Pueblo County (325 megawatts, plus
125 megawatts of storage) and the Thunder Wolf Energy Center in Pueblo County (248 megawatts, plus
100 megawatts of storage) came online in June 2023.
Southwest
In 2023, we proposed three company-owned solar projects with a combined capacity of 418 megawatts
(two in in New Mexico and one in Texas) as well as the Cunningham Unit 1 Battery Energy Storage,
a 36-megawatt project in New Mexico. The new company-owned solar facilities will be located at
Cunningham Generating Station near Hobbs, New Mexico, and Plant X Generating Station near
Earth, Texas.
The two solar plants at the Cunningham site would have a combined peak capacity of 268 megawatts,
and the Plant X facility would be 150 megawatts under optimal conditions. Placing the facilities at these
locations supports the existing workforce and host communities while saving customers money by
using existing grid connections. Combined, the facilities would power about 140,000 typical Xcel Energy
customer homes on average, with total capacity totaling approximately 280 megawatts. The new solar
facilities could be in service between 2026 and 2027.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 23
Integrating Wind and Solar Power
Major growth in our wind and solar capacity has fundamentally changed the way we operate. We’ve set
multiple system records for delivering wind and solar power. During 2023, we recorded several hours in
each jurisdiction when wind and solar energy produced 90% or more of our electricity as well as entire
days when these resources produced about 80% of our power within these jurisdictions.
We continue to improve system operations and create the ability to reliably increase the use of renewables.
Our operational improvements include:
• Investing in transmission: We’re adding new transmission facilities to reduce congestion, increase
regional reliability and create new capacity for delivering more wind and solar energy to customers.
• Developing energy storage: Large-scale lithium-ion battery energy storage systems and long-
duration storage projects allow us to store excess renewable energy and provide dispatchable
capacity during periods when wind and solar generation are low.
• Using control equipment: We use set-point controls for wind and solar farms in combination with
automatic controls on thermal units, which enables renewable generation to operate at peak levels
and reduces fossil fuel generation.
• Increasing the flexibility of our dispatchable power plant fleet: Lower-carbon natural gas plants
are the primary dispatchable resource for backing up and integrating renewable energy. We’ve
upgraded instrumentation and software and made other improvements, such as negotiating more
flexible agreements with natural gas suppliers, that enable us to operate the system more reliably
and help manage customer costs.
• Cycling baseload plants offline and reducing minimum generation levels: We operate our coal
and nuclear units to accommodate more renewable generation, ramping the units down to reduce
fuel use and emissions.
• Adjusting planned maintenance: We plan transmission and plant maintenance outages to navigate
reliability needs and take advantage of times of year when wind and solar production are lowest.
• Winterizing wind turbines: All the wind turbines we own across our three regions are outfitted
with cold weather turbine packages that support operations down to -22° F (-30° C).
Regional Energy Markets
Larger regional power grid operators and energy markets offer greater flexibility to add more wind and solar
power. They can provide renewable resource diversity on neighboring systems and help displace thermal
generation with renewables more economically.
• C olorado: We continue to explore participation in a larger regional energy market. Along with other
energy providers in the state, we joined the Western Energy Imbalance Service (WEIS) Market
operated by Southwest Power Pool (SPP), a regional transmission organization covering parts of the
central U.S. in early 2023. It’s a short- to mid-term move that will provide cost savings to customers
and improve operational efficiencies while we evaluate a longer-term, broader market structure to
integrate wind and solar energy and maintain system reliability.
• S outhwest: Our operations in Texas and New Mexico participate in SPP. In spring 2023, we agreed
to join Phase 1 of SPP’s proposed Markets+ initiative to participate in the service design. Markets+
seeks to expand WEIS by providing a centralized day-ahead and real-time energy market for the
West. We expect to decide whether to continue participating after an extensive review of the final
design by early 2025.
• Upper Midwest: We belong to MISO.

Exceeding Compliance with State Energy Standards and Use of Renewable Energy Credits
Even as state requirements continue to evolve, we remain committed to meeting or surpassing established
standards beyond 2030 in the states we serve. We continuously optimize our compliance strategy with
increased target requirements based on each state’s legislation. All states in which we operate have
passed legislation for increased renewable and clean energy standards. Our state's respective renewable
portfolio and clean energy standards are:
• C olorado: In 2004, Colorado became the first state to enact a renewable energy standard by
ballot measure. Since passage, the Colorado renewable energy standard has been amended by the
legislature and now requires investor-owned utilities to deliver 30% of retail sales from carbon-free
technology by 2020 and beyond.
• M ichigan: In 2023, Michigan expanded renewable energy requirements substantially and added a
clean energy standard. The state requires electricity suppliers to generate 60% of their retail sales
from renewable energy sources by 2035 and 100% clean energy sources by 2040.
• M innesota: Recent legislation requires 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 with interim targets.
Minnesota also has a long-standing renewable portfolio standard requiring 55% of energy generation
by 2035 to come from renewable energy technologies.
• New Mexico: The state requires 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045 with interim targets of 50% by
2030 and 80% by 2040. New Mexico also includes a renewable portfolio standard of 40% by 2025.
• North Dakota: There is no renewable portfolio standard requirement in North Dakota.
• South Dakota: This state has a 10% voluntary renewable portfolio standard requirement.
• Texas: House Bill 1500 was revised to require only a solar renewable portfolio standard requirement
by 2025; renewable standards in Texas will terminate after 2025.
• W isconsin: Northern States Power Company has a renewable portfolio standard of 12.89%.
Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) are used as a mechanism to comply with state renewable energy
standards. A renewable energy certificate or credit is created for each megawatt hour of generated
renewable electricity and is the unit of compliance for state renewable energy standards and some
voluntary buyers’ sustainability goals. They are tracked in national REC registries, which are approved by
our state PUCs.
Our policy is to manage our RECs to best serve customers, comply with renewable and carbon emissions
requirements and avoid regulatory penalties for customers. As of July 2021, we stopped initiating the
sale of RECs generated from our portfolio, unless it is necessary to avoid such penalties on a state-by-
state basis. To help customers achieve their voluntary and incremental sustainability goals and to avoid
double counting concerns, RECs may be transferred or retired to Xcel Energy customers through voluntary
program offerings, contractual or wholesale contracts. Additionally, we provide a residual mix carbon
emission intensity metric by operating system, which excludes RECs we have already retired on behalf of
or transferred to certain customers and RECs sold to avoid regulatory penalties. The residual mix carbon
emission intensity also reflects energy purchased through any power purchase agreement where we do
not purchase the associated REC.
Only parties that own and retire RECs can claim to use renewable energy, according to the Federal Trade
Commission. Therefore, we carefully track our REC ownership in compliance with the rules and best
practices around renewable energy claims. However, renewable energy that does not have an associated
REC can retain its value and be used for compliance with environmental regulations, like greenhouse gas
reduction targets. In reporting progress against our carbon reduction goals, our company uses actual
carbon emissions from energy provided to our customers, independent of whether there was a REC
associated with that energy.

Clean Fuels
Clean fuels not only help us achieve our environmental goals but also present growth opportunities for our
business. We’re exploring using hydrogen and other clean fuels to provide an alternative to natural gas and
to produce electricity, supporting grid reliability as we add renewable energy sources.
Clean Hydrogen Production Demonstration
Our innovative proof-of-concept pilot will show how hydrogen can be produced using carbon-free energy
at the Prairie Island Nuclear Plant. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded Xcel Energy and its
partners, Bloom Energy and Idaho National Laboratory, approximately $10 million for the $12 million
project, which will use the plant’s electricity and steam to produce hydrogen from water.
A semi-trailer-sized high-temperature steam electrolysis system developed by Bloom Energy will separate
the hydrogen and oxygen molecules in water. At full capacity, the pilot will be able to produce about
90 kilograms of hydrogen per day. Scaled up, this carbon-free hydrogen could potentially be used in
other industries that would benefit from efficient, local hydrogen production sources.
Heartland Hydrogen Hub
The DOE selected the Heartland Hydrogen Hub (HH2H), including multiple clean hydrogen projects from
Xcel Energy, for award negotiations to receive up to $415 million for the company and $925 million total as
part of the Hydrogen Hub program under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The award will serve
as a catalyst for a future hydrogen ecosystem. HH2H is one of seven selected to receive funding nationally.
Xcel Energy’s scope for the hub plans to produce and use low-carbon hydrogen at commercial scale across
our service territories. The hub aims to reduce carbon emissions by more than 1 million metric tons per
year, the equivalent of taking 220,000 gas-powered cars off the road.
Hydrogen Blending Studies
We have participated in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) HyBlend Project, which seeks
to address technical barriers associated with blending hydrogen in natural gas infrastructure. Phase 2 of
this work is kicking off in 2024 and seeks to further research material compatibility of metals and polymers
for hydrogen blending. In 2023, we partnered with a global provider of professional project and asset
services and completed a high-level study evaluating the feasibility of injecting and blending hydrogen into
our existing natural gas system companywide. The Clean Fuels and Gas Operations teams will utilize these
results to better focus on targeted locations for future hydrogen blending on the system.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel Hub
Xcel Energy joined Bank of America, Delta Air Lines and Ecolab in establishing the Minnesota Sustainable
Aviation Fuel (SAF) Hub. Our role will be to provide clean energy, both carbon-free electricity and
carbon-free hydrogen, to sustainable aviation fuel production facilities across Minnesota. SAF is a safe,
fully certified jet fuel that can be used in today’s aircraft engines and transported via existing pipeline
infrastructure. Produced from many sources including renewable feedstocks and used cooking oil, SAF
can reduce life cycle carbon emissions of aviation by more than 80%.
Renewable Natural Gas
Renewable natural gas (RNG) is pipeline-compatible gaseous fuel derived from biogenic or other renewable
sources that has lower lifecycle carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) emissions than geological natural gas.
We have several RNG facilities interconnected to our natural gas system in Colorado and Minnesota, which
help build the market for RNG — an important step toward reducing the carbon intensity on our natural
gas system.
We have included RNG pilot initiatives in our recently filed Colorado Clean Heat Plan and Minnesota Natural
Gas Innovation Act Plan. One project aims to offtake RNG with its environmental attributes — created in part
by organic food scraps diverted from landfills — and will use an innovative High Solids Anaerobic Digester
technology to capture organics from municipal solid waste feedstock, resulting in the production of RNG from
the organics and biochar from the solid digestate. This groundbreaking technology has only been deployed in
California. It would also help Minnesota reach its recycling goals of 75% by 2030.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 26
Venture Capital
Through strategic support of venture capital, we stay on the leading edge of new technologies and
business applications. New investments include:
• E nergy Impact Partners – Fund III: established three tracks — Clean Electrons, Clean Molecules
and the Built Environment — to complement our clean energy goals. The learnings and exposure to
pioneering technology also sets us up for future success.
• Energize Capital (formerly Energize Ventures) – Growth II Fund: seeks to provide capital and
operational support to growth-stage, climate-solution-focused software companies for critical
energy insights.
Xcel Energy continues to be actively engaged in various other funds, which not only strive to focus on
technology and business but also diversity, equity and inclusion. Our participation allows us to collaborate
with peer companies and gain insights into the business models and technologies of innovative companies.
We share diverse, global perspectives, positioning us to successfully manage policy changes in the states
we serve.
Rapid Innovation
Our partnerships in venture capital, the Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI) Incubatenergy Labs and
other programs give us the visibility and opportunity to demonstrate leading-edge technology and concepts
that support our strategic priorities. Rapid Innovation is our 16-week limited-scope framework that enables
business areas to quickly prove the value of new services, hardware and software. Vendors are selected
for the demonstration only. Examples include:
• Noteworthy AI: Analogous to our use of drone-captured imagery and AI to inspect transmission
lines, Distribution Operations demonstrated Noteworthy AI’s ability to identify and prioritize defects
found on poles, pole-mounted assets and conductors by applying AI to images captured by vehicle-
mounted high-resolution cameras. Thus far, over 56,700 images were captured identifying more
than 21,000 poles and nearly 46,500 assets. As this demonstration winds down, additional analysis
will determine how the concept of passive pole and asset inspection may improve as well as extend
further for distribution operations.
• Virtual reality (VR) training*: In mid-2024, our Learning Solutions team will begin a VR
demonstration to train operators of solar generation facilities and wind turbines. Using FacilitateTech’s
VR creation suite, we will deploy a limited-scope, state-of-the-art training program focused on safety
hazard awareness. This demonstration will compare operator feedback and knowledge retention
between VR and traditional training programs, thus informing how to further utilize and improve VR
content creation and the overall training methodology.
• Acoustic wind turbine blade monitoring*: Our Wind Generation team will demonstrate real-time
acoustic monitoring from the Mistras Group on two wind turbines at the Hale Wind Farm in Texas.
The Sensoria system continuously “listens” for resonance variances as the blades spin and aims
to identify cracks, delaminations, ruptures, perforations, impacts and lightning strikes. Early defect
detection can significantly reduce repair costs and downtime while improving output and worker
safety. Proving this concept will inform Xcel Energy how this low-cost capability may benefit its
entire fleet of wind generation.
*Demonstration project development in progress.
Electric Power Research Institute
Through our long-time membership with the EPRI, we gain insights into the challenges and opportunities
associated with advanced clean energy and emission-reduction technologies. These include:
• Electric system resiliency, climate scenario analysis and greenhouse gas reduction goals.
• Emerging technologies that will provide firm, dispatchable and reliable electricity to support
our 2050 goal.
• Renewables integration, electric vehicles, combined heat and power, customer demand response
and energy efficiency.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 27
• Informing regulators and customers on the technical and economic opportunities and challenges of
new grid technologies, such as energy storage and distributed generation.
In this collaborative research environment, we engage with other organizations that are developing and
evaluating new products to optimize and analyze distributed energy resources on the power grid.
Xcel Energy participates in the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative led by EPRI and GTI Energy. It’s a five-year
research and development commitment to advance low-carbon fuels production and use at large-scale
deployments by the electric and gas utility sectors. The goal is to create risk-informed understanding of
options and technologies for 2030 and beyond through global partnerships and demonstrations, applied
engineering developments and technology acceleration of the most promising options.
NOTEWORTHY
Long-Duration Energy Storage
We are partnering with Form Energy and Argonne National Laboratory to deploy long-duration energy
storage technology that will be connected to the transmission grid. Form Energy’s iron-air battery can
provide continuous power for 100 hours. Sourced from the abundant material, iron and the oxygen in the
air, Form Energy’s technology will help store electricity from renewable generators that would otherwise be
curtailed, which will be returned to the grid when renewable resources drop off for multiple days at time.
The technology stands apart from many other battery technologies because it was purpose-built from
analysis that showed the value of a low-cost battery that could provide multiple days of reliable power. This
project will deploy up to two 10-megawatt batteries with 100 hours of dispatchable storage at retiring coal
plants in Minnesota and Colorado. Grant awards commitments from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and the
DOE will support the project.
Beneficial Electrification and Clean Heat
Xcel Energy operates in challenging climates and geographies, and our territory provides ideal conditions
to demonstrate how heat-pump technology performs in extreme conditions in our customers’ homes.
We participate in several federal programs to assess and advance the performance and potential of
heat pumps.
• We are partnering with NREL to study the real-world effectiveness of cold climate heat pumps at
high altitude. The first phase of the study is complete. This partnership includes laboratory testing,
high mountain field testing and customer sited single family home field tests. This near-real-world
impact study will thoroughly test heat pump operation in our harshest climate conditions.
• We are on the advisory board of a DOE-funded study on advanced controls for cold-climate heat
pumps in dual fuel applications.
• We are participating in the DOE Cold-Climate Heat Pump Challenge to manufacturers. This work
seeks to extend the capability of heat pumps by addressing changes in refrigerant requirements
and establishing lower operating temperatures in two segments, below 5° F and below -15° F,
temperatures routinely experienced in our service territories.
• We are on the advisory committee for a DOE study of hybrid heat pump controls. The research
project is testing and monitoring advanced control strategies to optimize dual-fuel heat pump
controls and validate efficiency, demand reduction and emission reduction benefits.

Energy and Environmental Policy
Our Energy and Environmental Policy department lays the foundation for the company’s approach to
reducing waste and supporting biodiversity while minimizing our impact on air, water and land and setting
ambitious clean energy and carbon reduction goals. It covers all environmental media communications and
sets expectations that align with our business practices.
Through our duty to provide customers with low-cost, reliable energy, we balance our commitment
to achieving environmental excellence and leadership. We work to conduct our operations in an
environmentally responsible and compliant manner by:
• Monitoring and minimizing environmental impacts.
• Ensuring compliance with new and revised environmental regulations.
• Meeting regulatory requirements and investing in environmentally sound technologies.
• Evaluating costs and benefits to inform adoption of pollution prevention measures in operations and
resource planning.
• Minimizing corporate risk and liability arising from environmental issues.
• Performing environmental due diligence before beginning a new project or real estate transaction.
• Engaging with stakeholders to address environmental issues.
• Training and empowering employees to take responsibility for protecting the environment and
environmental activities related to their jobs.
When making decisions, we consider opportunities to reduce emissions, eliminate waste and conserve
or protect resources, often participating in environmental research, stewardship projects and community
partnerships.
We have more than 50 policies, procedures and guidance documents that support our ongoing
performance and foster environmental excellence, which all Xcel Energy employees, contractors and
vendors are expected to follow.
Environmental Justice
As an energy provider, we are positioned to advance environmental justice and clean energy equity in our
communities. Our Environmental Justice Position Statement commits us to consider clean energy
equity in our strategic energy, climate and environmental initiatives and outlines key objectives, such as
ensuring disadvantaged communities have the opportunity to participate in energy and climate decisions that
impact them.
The following initiatives touch several areas of our business, including employment and sourcing,
construction planning and permitting, giving and volunteering, product and program design, public policy
and community involvement at all levels of government:
• Continuous improvement in environmental performance, improving air quality and reducing water use
and waste.
• Striving to ensure equitable allocation of both costs and opportunities from our expanding carbon-
free energy system.
• Making clean energy options and services available to all of our customers.
• Viewing energy affordability, reliability and resiliency as critical to the well-being of the communities
we serve, especially to vulnerable people.
• Developing partnerships in disproportionately impacted communities near our facilities.
• Supporting the continued vitality of places affected by the transition away from coal.
• Encouraging inclusion and participation by making outreach events easier for anyone to access —
considering location, multiple language support, timing, the needs of parents and disabled people,
how events are publicized and other factors.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 31
An example of our work to advance equity and environmental justice is the Equity Stakeholder Advisory
Group (ESAG), which consists of over 30 Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) community-based
organizations, low-income advocates, public agencies and other equity stakeholders working to center
equity in the design of a broad range of energy programs. ESAG has focused on reducing energy burden
for low-income customers, broadening access to energy efficiency, equitable access to renewable energy
and energy workforce diversification. A key emphasis has been broadening participation and providing new
ways for disadvantaged communities to influence energy decisions that impact them.
The first formal ESAG outcome, a regulatory filing proposing an automated bill credit program in high
energy-burden census areas, was filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in the
spring of 2024. Our work with ESAG is transitioning into the convening of a smaller Environmental Justice
Accountability Board. Since convening in the fall of 2022, we continue to meet monthly.
An Equitable Energy Future
To address environmental injustices that disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income
neighborhoods in Minneapolis, Minnesota, we partner with Sabathani Community Center through
initiatives like the Resilient Minneapolis Project (RMP) and active participation in ESAG.
The RMP is instrumental in enhancing community-level resilience and ensuring uninterrupted access
to critical services during natural disasters across three locations. Our engagement with ESAG has also
facilitated meaningful conversations and actionable steps toward promoting equitable access to energy
efficiency and renewable energy programs.
In addition to these initiatives, we have also supported
Sabathani Energy Day, a career fair and celebration
that engages the community and paves the way for
accessible, livable wage careers and sustainable energy
solutions, and Sabathani’s Environmental Sustainability
Academy, which equips community youth with the
skills and knowledge needed for successful careers in
renewable energy.
“Xcel Energy's support extends beyond advocacy and
dialogue,” said Sabathani communications coordinator
Justin Leaf. “They have demonstrated a commitment
to improving resilience and reducing energy burdens for
BIPOC communities. Sabathani is proud to partner with
Xcel Energy in creating a more sustainable and equitable
future for all.”
Reducing Air Emissions
We plan to retire or repower all remaining coal-fueled plants by the end of 2030.
• We retired Sherco 2, one of three coal units at the Sherburne County (Sherco) Generating Plant in
Minnesota, at the end of 2023. Construction is underway for Sherco Solar, which will be the largest
solar facility in the Midwest.
• In 2024, we will convert the coal-fueled Harrington Generating Station northeast of Amarillo, Texas,
to operate on natural gas.
• In 2025, we will shut down Unit 2 at Comanche Station in Pueblo, Colorado; we retired Comanche
Unit 1 in 2022. Comanche Unit 3 will retire by the end of 2030.

Monitoring and Managing Water Risks
A dependable water supply is critical to running a fleet of dispatchable power plants — those available
24/7, such as thermal, nuclear and hydroelectric plants. We need this “always available” power supply
in conjunction with variable renewable energy as part of a reliable power grid.
Xcel Energy operates in different climatic and hydrologic regions, requiring a multifaceted approach to
risk mitigation.
• By using sophisticated hydrologic and statistical modeling tools, we evaluate the impact of future
climate change on water supplies.
• In each region, we consider the appropriate cooling technology, water or wastewater treatment
options as well as the needs of other water users and stakeholders.
• We review the historic record and generation forecasts for plants that use water to assess supply
vulnerability and develop strategies.
• To mitigate the impact of drought, we own a diverse portfolio of complementary water rights and
supplies, such as reservoir storage, groundwater rights, reusable effluent and direct flow.

For contracted water, we’re releasing it back to the owner or water authority for other uses, decreasing
the water utility’s need to further develop water resources to support regional growth. We engage with
other water users and stakeholders to create mutually beneficial partnerships and innovative agreements to
leverage water supply benefits for all participants. These agreements include:
• Under a long-standing agreement on Colorado River water, we reduce generation at our Shoshone
hydroelectric plant during severe drought, which allows Denver Water and others to refill their
reservoirs.
• In very dry years, Colorado farmers will let parcels of land go fallow if they lack the water supply to
produce marketable crops. Under an interruptible water supply agreement, we buy limited quantities
of their allocations to use in our plants. This helps farmers whose revenues are impacted by drought
without jeopardizing their existing water rights, while supplying water needed to maintain reliable
generation through this period. We were the first to establish this long-standing agreement, which
is adopted in the state’s Colorado Water Plan as a tool to promote resiliency.
• Tolk Generating Station in Texas relies on groundwater from the Ogallala Aquifer. We are planning to
retire the plant by the end of 2028, which will help preserve nonrenewable groundwater in the region
for use by agriculture and municipal users, both critical sectors of the regional economy.
• We participate in the Minnesota Sustainable Growth Coalition, a business-led partnership that
promotes a circular economy. The coalition focuses on energy, water and waste issues to use
resources efficiently.
• A renegotiated water contract for Rocky Mountain Energy Center will return 2,000 acre-feet currently
leased from the City of Aurora in Colorado, saving us an estimated $100 million over the remaining
plant life and securing water supply for the plant until 2050. Aurora expects similar benefits in
avoided water purchases, opportunities to continue to support local agricultural operations, avoided
or delayed infrastructure improvements, and increased system reliability for their customers.
Our water goal, which is linked to our clean energy transition and increased wind and solar generation,
is to reduce consumption from the electricity provided to customers by 70% by 2030 from 2005 levels.
As we retire coal operations, we’re retaining existing, owned water rights to support future uses and
technologies, which could potentially include advanced nuclear, geothermal, hydrogen and pumped
storage.

NOTEWORTHY
Advancing Colorado’s Water Security
In December 2023, the Colorado River Water Conservation District made a deal with Xcel Energy to purchase
the Shoshone water rights, one of the oldest and largest nonconsumptive rights on the Colorado River, for
$98.5 million. This agreement is considered one of the most significant water rights changes in Colorado’s
history. It will help provide permanent protection of the most senior, nonconsumptive water right on the
Colorado River, a project with a 20-year history of support from 19 western Colorado governments and
water entities.
In addition to preserving the water rights that flow through our Shoshone Hydro Plant turbines on the
Colorado River, this agreement allows us to continue generating clean electricity for the 1.6 million electric
customers and communities we serve statewide while also supporting the local economy of the Western
Slope with good jobs and tax revenue. On top of the sale, we provided nearly $66,000 in shareholder
funded grants for water and riparian projects in the area.
Managing Water Supply and Discharges
Thermal Operations in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas
Our thermal plants in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas use closed-loop cooling, which minimizes
freshwater withdrawals by recirculating water — up to 25 times at some plants. Many are zero-discharge
facilities where no process water leaves the site. Advanced water treatment technologies separate waste
for disposal while returning most processed water to the plant, reducing reliance on other supplies.
We operate six major thermal power plants in Colorado, including four zero-discharge facilities. Other
plants that discharge to nearby waterways follow all state and federal environmental regulations, as
outlined in their individual permits. Of seven major thermal power plants in New Mexico and Texas,
six do not discharge water directly.
Every year, we update strategic water resource plans for Colorado, New Mexico and Texas to reflect local
climate and hydrologic conditions, forecasted demand for electricity and water, and available supplies.
Among the tools we use:
• Advanced multivariate generation demand forecasting and resulting water demand forecasts.
• Snowpack and water yield modeling to support stochastic water supply forecasts.
• Advanced groundwater modeling predicting both water yield and long-term water supply availability
for plants supplied by groundwater derived from the Ogallala Aquifer.
Xcel Energy and water suppliers have improved supplies and adopted drought response plans to ensure
they meet their municipal and industrial obligations. We have partnered with municipalities and farmers to
pioneer interruptible water supply agreements, activated by disruptive events like severe drought or major
forest fires. Under these agreements, our water supplies are augmented, offsetting reductions that may
occur elsewhere in the system and reducing the risk to reliable generation.
Our Water Resources staff is active in state water planning in Colorado and Texas. Our Cherokee plant in
Colorado and Jones, Nichols and Harrington plants in Texas use treated municipal effluent for cooling, a
highly reliable water supply in arid regions. The practice helps preserve billions of gallons of freshwater
and minimizes competition between the needs of power plants and other water users.

Thermal and Nuclear Operations in the Upper Midwest
In the Upper Midwest, all but one of our nuclear and thermal plants use open-loop or once-through
cooling, which continuously withdraws water from nearby rivers and then returns it to serve other users.
Although water withdrawals are higher with open-loop cooling, consumption is lower; our plants return
about 99% of the water they withdraw. The exception is Sherco, which uses closed-loop cooling.
The plants follow the requirements of state water appropriation and federal Clean Water Act wastewater
discharge permits, designed to meet the federal government’s goals for maintaining swimmable and
fishable waterbodies. We treat, monitor and analyze the water to ensure facilities meet discharge
requirements and report monitoring data monthly to state agencies.

Water Leak at Monticello Plant
Xcel Energy took action to contain a tritiated water leak at the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant in
November 2022. State and federal regulators and public health officials confirmed the leak posed no health
and safety risk to plant employees, residents or the environment. The plant was powered down in March
2023 to complete permanent repairs of the leak and was returned to service within a few weeks.
The on-site groundwater monitoring system detected low levels of radioactive tritium. Tritium levels were
below Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety thresholds and potential contamination was contained to the
plant site. We identified the source of the leak to an underground pipe between two buildings. Initially, we
put in a system to capture water from the leaking pipe and reroute it back into the plant for reuse. When
our leak monitoring indicated the system was no longer fully capturing the leak, we opted to power down
the plant for permanent repairs rather than waiting for a regularly scheduled refueling outage.
Piping at the plant has been inspected and the section of pipe that leaked is being examined in a lab to
understand the leak’s root cause. We constructed new monitoring and recovery wells, increased the
frequency of measurements and will continue to partner with local officials and groundwater specialists.
We continue pumping tritium-impacted groundwater so that it can be stored and reused onsite. As of
May 2024, we have pumped nearly 8 million gallons of groundwater and have recovered a majority of
the estimated 14 curies of tritium released. Regular sampling of monitoring wells confirms there are no
identified releases to the neighboring Mississippi River as of May 2023.
Hydroelectric Operations
We operate 26 hydroelectric plants — six in Colorado, one in Minnesota and 19 in Wisconsin — with
capacity to power more than 308,000 homes. The only water loss from hydro plants occurs through
natural evaporation. Our sites range from secluded scenic areas to urban recreation areas. We work
with environmental and wildlife agencies to monitor water quality, protect aquatic life, ensure minimum
stream flow, prevent erosion and control invasive plants. Our hydroelectric plants operate on the
following waterways:

Investment Recovery: Pursuing Sustainability through Reuse,
Resale and Recycling
Our Investment Recovery group optimizes outcomes for surplus equipment and salvages materials through
reuse, resale and recycling, working closely with facility and project management to find productive
outlets for materials with a secondary value. This provides environmental benefit and cost savings.
Reuse is at the top of the surplus equipment and materials management hierarchy. Some items, like
vehicles, have been resold for years, but other markets are expanding as Xcel Energy and other sellers
look to monetize items we no longer need and buyers seek workarounds for supply chain issues.
In 2023, we recovered approximately $16 million through sales of surplus/retired equipment and
recyclable materials, helping to offset operating costs and benefiting customers and the environment.
Highlights include:
• Fleet vehicle sales: Nearly 450 retired cars, trucks, trailers and heavy equipment sold for
continued use.
• Surplus and obsolete equipment and parts sales: 276 discreet sales of assorted items, such as
welding machines, tools, transformers and computers.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 37
• Minnesota Valley Plant demolition: This 1930s era coal-fired generation plant was demolished
by implosion in October 2022, with on-site material removal activities completed in May 2023.
We recycled more than 9 tons of metal and 4 tons of brick, which will be reused as base material
for outbuilding pads and residential driveways. The value recovered from recycled material offset
demolition costs by more than 10%.
• Advanced Grid initiative: As we continue our multiyear upgrade to smart meters, we developed
guidelines to properly dispose of hazardous components from 1.9 million old meters and manage
recyclable material. The project kicked off in Colorado in 2020. Batteries, mercury-filled devices
and other nonrecyclable materials were processed by waste vendors, according to our company’s
requirements. To date, 3,200 tons of material have been recycled from this project.

Material Recycling
We select vendors to recycle materials through a competitive bid process. Before we contract, we
investigate how each material will be managed and evaluate whether the vendor is qualified and
understands their responsibilities for following all applicable environmental regulations.
Some recyclable wastes, such as oil or batteries, can have adverse environmental impacts if mismanaged.
To help prevent this, vendors for these recyclables are reviewed under the same approved vendor program
we use for waste disposal.

Coal Ash Management
Coal-fueled power plants produce coal combustion residuals or byproducts, commonly known as coal
ash. Over the next several years, all production of coal ash will wind down as we retire remaining coal
operations by the end of 2030. Since 2005, we have reduced coal ash production 58%. In 2023, 26%
of coal ash produced was beneficially reused.
Coal Ash Production and Reuse
We try to reuse coal ash for beneficial purposes to save natural resources. In 2023, just over one-quarter
of the coal ash we produced was reused for engineered fill material, concrete, roofing shingles and other
uses — including 100% of the ash from two plants in Texas. When we sell coal ash to third parties, their
intended reuse must meet product and safety specifications and be consistent with the Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA) definition of beneficial use. Our contracts allow only encapsulated beneficial
use or unencapsulated beneficial use in quantities less than 12,400 tons for non-roadway applications.
As we replace older coal-fired power plants with cleaner generation sources, we produce less coal ash. At
our remaining coal plants, emission controls such as scrubbers and activated carbon for controlling mercury
emissions, have changed the ash composition and made it potentially less marketable. We continue to
explore beneficial uses that are economically productive and protect of the environment.

Company-Operated Coal Ash Facilities and Meeting the Coal Combustion Residuals Rule
Coal ash produced at our generating plants is either beneficially reused, stored or disposed of at permitted
third-party landfills or at company-operated coal ash facilities. Xcel Energy follows the EPA’s Coal
Combustion Residuals Rule (CCR Rule), which sets standards for design, operation and closure of coal
ash landfills and surface impoundments. We also meet state requirements for construction standards and
operational requirements for coal ash storage and disposal. The CCR Rule includes a protocol for monitoring
and protecting groundwater around coal ash facilities. Xcel Energy CCR landfills and impoundments are also
subject to design and operational requirements specified in state regulations.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 39
We currently operate eight active coal ash storage or disposal facilities, including two impoundments and
a landfill at Sherco in Minnesota and five landfills in Colorado, including two at Pawnee Generating Station
and one each at Comanche, Hayden and Valmont stations. The landfill at the Valmont property is no longer
in use. In addition, we are in the process of closing two impoundments, one at Sherco and the other at
Comanche. In recent years, we have closed more than half our active impoundments and removed coal ash
from 15 inactive impoundments at our power plant sites.
As of year-end 2023, our groundwater monitoring program indicates exceedances of groundwater
protection standards at Cherokee, Comanche, Hayden, Pawnee and Valmont stations in Colorado.
Investigation and/or corrective action under the federal CCR program related to these groundwater impacts
are underway. However, we completed a study in accordance with EPA requirements that suggests the
source of cobalt exceedances in the groundwater at Hayden Station originates from sources not associated
with coal ash management.
Under State of Colorado requirements, at Hayden Station we’ve implemented corrective measures
comprised of a systematic study of site conditions to assess the nature and extent of a contaminated
site with the intent of developing a remedy that can be executed to eliminate the contamination so that
groundwater protection standards are met within a reasonable time. CCR Rule requires we continue
monitoring groundwater and take corrective measures for these locations. Exceeding a groundwater
protection standard does not mean there’s an environmental or public safety concern, only that further
evaluation is warranted.
We’re working closely with the EPA on the groundwater investigation and possible solutions at Cherokee,
Comanche, Pawnee and Valmont. This includes continued implementation of a cooperative consent
agreement that was reached with the EPA in 2022 for Comanche. In 2023, we hosted public meetings to
discuss possible corrective actions at Comanche, Pawnee and Valmont and expect to implement corrective
measures at all three locations in 2024. We also expect to host public meetings to discuss potential
corrective actions at Cherokee in 2024.
Through our Valmont Beneficial Reuse project, we plan to permanently close most cells of the Valmont
Station landfill by removing coal ash for beneficial use. Our contractor will set up operations to excavate and
process a high percentage of the coal ash from the landfill for processing and sale into the local ready-mix
concrete market.
At Sherco, which is a zero-discharge facility, we operate three active CCR units regulated by the CCR
rule, including an 18-acre bottom ash pond built in 2020 with a composite liner to meet EPA and State of
Minnesota design requirements. We also operate a 100-acre impoundment where coal ash is managed in
a wet condition. This was assigned the EPA’s highest rating of Satisfactory by EPA contractor Lockheed
Martin in 2009. A lined landfill on plant property is used to manage the coal ash generated from the plant in
a dry condition. When these CCR units are closed, they will be capped with an engineered, protective cover
system. These CCR units were constructed so that liquids can be removed after the final cap has been
installed. The active impoundments at Sherco are classified as significant hazard surface impoundments
per the Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety.

Other Operational Wastes
At power plants, in service centers and substations or with field crews, we strive to follow best practices
to manage waste. This begins by preventing the generation of waste, where feasible, and continually
improving our processes for responsible management and disposal of the waste we generate. We also
promote the safe use and storage of products. Our employees and contractors are trained in safe and
responsible practices. When waste must be disposed of, we do so through responsible means, using
vetted and certified disposal partners and within regulatory guidelines.
Restricting Product Use
We maintain a list of targeted ingredients of highly regulated substances and emerging contaminants of
concern with potential environmental or health impacts. We work to restrict their use, if viable alternatives
exist, and extend this process where applicable to on-site contractors through our environmental directives
for contractors.
Our facilities have implemented compliance programs to ensure employees are trained to properly store
products and materials to minimize waste generation and to protect the environment from potential
releases. Over the decades, we have significantly reduced the quantities of hazardous waste generated
through the implementation of these programs. Xcel Energy has only one location in Wisconsin that
produces enough hazardous waste to classify as a Large Quantity Generator — a groundwater treatment
system that serves the Ashland Superfund site. Approximately 94% of our facilities, including power plants
and service centers, are classified as Very Small Quantity Generators, generating less than 220 pounds
per month.
Collection and Disposal of Regulated Wastes
All Xcel Energy employees share responsibility for properly managing our waste streams. The
Environmental Services department is responsible for the company’s waste management program, which
focuses on regulatory compliance, generating less waste and reducing environmental impacts.
To minimize risks associated with the specially regulated waste generated, we exclusively use vendors
that we systematically evaluate and pre-approve. We have formed an approved vendor stakeholder group
to assess waste vendors and to promote disposal practices where feasible to reduce the long-term liability
associated with the waste we generate. For example, in 2023, 21% of the hazardous waste generated was
diverted from disposal. Of the total amount of hazardous waste generated in 2023, only 10% was disposed
of in a landfill. The remaining hazardous waste was managed so that the hazardous characteristics of the
waste were eliminated by either treatment, incineration or consumption for energy production at
permitted facilities.

Excluding ash residuals from our waste-to-energy facilities, coal-fired plants and biomass-fired plants,
59,979 tons of nonhazardous specially regulated wastes were generated by Xcel Energy. Nonhazardous
specially regulated wastes include industrial and commercial waste streams that cannot be combined

nonhazardous contaminated soils, universal wastes such as lamps and batteries, ash-contaminated
wastes, oil filters, PCB-contaminated equipment, debris and oil. In 2023, 8% of this waste was diverted
from disposal.
PCB Phaseout Effort
We make dedicated efforts to remove known PCB equipment from our system, including transformers,
breakers, capacitors and other oil-filled electrical equipment. In many cases, we have retrofitted large
substation equipment to reduce PCBs to nonregulated levels. Through our normal maintenance practices,
we remove equipment identified as containing regulated levels of PCBs and replace it with non-PCB
equipment unless there are extenuating circumstances in design or procurement. Overall, for managing
hazardous or special wastes, we prefer disposal methods like incineration or detoxification, which eliminate
the PCBs from the waste stream and keep them out of the environment.

penalties. If there are disputes about the alleged noncompliance, even when we believe we remained
in compliance, settlements are often reached to avoid the costs of litigation and to cooperate with the
regulatory agency. Every year, as part of our internal and ongoing efforts to self-identify and self-correct any
potential noncompliance issues, we conduct our own facility audits. We received the following compliance

Recent enforcement actions include:
• The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued a Compliance Advisory to
Manchief Electric Generating Station for failure to meet certain provisions of its air permit related to
carbon monoxide emissions limits and monitoring requirements during startup and shutdown. These
concerns were self-disclosed by Xcel Energy to the Air Pollution Control Division.
• The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources issued a Letter of Non-compliance (LON) to the
French Island Generation Station for potential noncompliance of the benzene emission limit during
stack emissions testing on Unit 2 in April 2023. Xcel Energy determined the exceedance likely was
related to an error during stack testing. Retesting as required by the LON was conducted the week of
August 7, 2023, and demonstrated compliance with the standard.
• The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) issued an Administrative Penalty Order to the
Monticello Nuclear Plant for failure to obtain an Aboveground Storage Tank (AST) Major Facility
permit once it began filling Tank L1 with tritiated groundwater. The addition of this storage tank
increased the total AST capacity of the facility above the 1 million gallon permitting threshold, which
classifies the plant as a Major Facility subject to the permitting requirement. A Major Facility permit
was subsequently obtained by the facility.
• The MPCA issued an NOV to the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant for four unauthorized
releases of wastewater and other materials to the environment that were not reported to the
State Duty Officer and exceeding a limit for one parameter in May 2023. The Prairie Island plant
implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence.
• The MPCA issued an NOV to the Riverside Generating Station Plant for storage of significant
materials outdoors that were exposed to stormwater and, therefore, in violation of the conditional
no-exposure exclusion of the state stormwater regulations. Xcel Energy completed the corrective
actions required by MPCA, including 1) removing/storing materials in compliance with the no
exposure requirement and 2) training employees in proper storage of these materials in accordance
with regulations and/or permit requirements.
Community Right to Know and the Toxics Release Inventory Program
Under the EPA’s Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know Act, residents have the "right
to know" about potential hazards in their communities. Each year, facilities in specific industries that
manufacture, process or use any of these substances must report their releases to air, land and water.
The EPA manages the information in a publicly available database under the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)
program. We have participated since 1999, when the TRI program expanded to include electric utilities. We
annually report our releases, the result of using coal, oil and RDF to produce electricity. When these fuels
are combusted, they release trace amounts of TRI-reportable substances, including barium, chromium,
copper, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel and zinc.
TRI-reportable substances are reported by facility and release type: land, air and water. A facility’s releases
may change slightly from year to year based on the amount of electricity produced and the fuel that is
consumed as well as fuel composition and mineralogy.
From 2005 to 2022, we reduced releases under the program by more than 53% due to the decreased use
of coal. Most of our TRI-reportable substances are contained in coal ash at our plants, preventing them
from entering the air. We capture about 95% of these constituents and safely dispose of them in
managed landfills.

Governance
The Operations, Nuclear, Environmental and Safety Committee of the board
of directors annually reviews the company’s environmental performance,
including wildlife, habitat and land management strategy, and compliance.
Within Xcel Energy, the chief operations officer reports to the CEO and
oversees natural gas operations and electric distribution and transmission,
including land management and avian protection programs. The senior vice
president of Energy Supply reports to the chief operations officer and is
responsible for the company’s environmental compliance.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 47
Understanding Potential Impacts
As a first step to supporting biodiversity, we evaluate the potential for significant impacts related to
our operations as an energy provider. Potential impacts on the areas surrounding our operations vary
depending on the facility type (e.g., electric generation, transmission and distribution, service centers,
etc.), and project phases (short-term construction vs. ongoing operation).
For instance, fossil fuel-fired generating facilities can have air emissions, water quality and waste-related
impacts. Learn more about our efforts to reduce these impacts in our Environmental Management
brief. In comparison, a renewable energy facility like a wind farm, generally has minimal climate and other
environmental impacts but can disrupt wildlife and habitats.
We conducted an analysis to understand how our operations could impact land use, habitats and species
of special interest. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) software, we created buffers surrounding
each of our electric generation, transmission, distribution and service centers facility sites within a 0.5- or
1-mile range as applicable given the facility type. We cross-referenced this data with the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) dataset and each
state’s Natural Heritage Information System (NHIS) protected species data to determine which land and
species of biodiversity value may be in proximity and potentially impacted by our operations.
Operational sites owned, leased or managed adjacent to lands protected or managed by conservation
agencies assumed to be of biodiversity value are presented below.

Managing Potential Impacts
Based on the above analysis, there are nearly 30 potential endangered species and over 200 species of
interest in proximity to our facilities.1 We take several measures to minimize potential adverse operational
impacts and maximize positive impacts on biodiversity. Where such impacts can't be avoided or minimized,
we mitigate through acquiring take permits or enrolling in Candidate Conservation Agreements (CCAs). Our
approach aims to enhance synergies and reduce trade-offs between actions taken to manage biodiversity
and climate change impacts.
One example of a CCA is with the Texas Hornshell Mussel. As the last remaining freshwater mussel
native to New Mexico, it received Endangered Species Act protections in 2018. In 2021, we enrolled two
transmission projects into a CCA to reduce or eliminate threats to the Texas Hornshell Mussel and other
covered species. Working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Bureau of Land Management,
New Mexico State Land Office, and Center of Excellence, we voluntarily committed to implement or fund
specific conservation actions. In total, we have paid over $125,000 in conservation fees through the two
transmission projects, which are used to manage the program and implement conservation efforts. As part
of the agreement, we also implemented a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan for erosion and sediment
control.
Responsible Renewable Energy
Delivering the clean energy transition requires the addition of a significant amount of renewable capacity.
This means reducing carbon and other air emissions as well as requiring land for siting. We manage siting,
construction and operations to limit their impact on habitats and wildlife.
We also conduct renewable energy project infrastructure micrositing during a project’s development phase
to minimize direct and indirect impacts to biodiversity while maximizing output of generation assets. This
is accomplished by identifying habitats of ecological sensitivity, species of concern and other areas of
biological importance, and then evaluating potential impacts to those areas and species.
Industry-standard buffers, or avoidance areas, are used to help locate project infrastructure outside of
these sensitive areas to reduce potential effects. The mitigation hierarchy aims to avoid impacts, minimize
impacts when avoidance cannot be attained and compensate for or mitigate for residual impacts that
cannot be avoided.
Wind Energy Projects
To provide best management practices from early project conception through operation, we develop
detailed bird and bat conservation strategies for all company-owned wind energy facilities. We also use
the FWS Land-Based Wind Energy Guidelines, which provide a consistent framework to assess wildlife
protection strategies for potential sites; this informs site selection of company-owned wind energy. In
addition, we work with wind project developers and state and federal agencies to minimize impacts to
wildlife and habitat as much as we can.
During the construction and repowering of our wind projects, we put best management practices for
wildlife and habitat protection in place. Construction contractors receive site-specific environmental training
to identify and report wildlife issues. For example, we incorporate Minnesota DNR recommendations, such
as species-specific contractor training and wildlife-friendly erosion and sediment control, to avoid impacts
to the threatened Blanding’s turtle.
Solar Power Projects
Large-scale solar projects require approximately four to seven acres of land per megawatt of capacity.
We aim to make the most of the property that supports our company-owned community solar gardens in
Boulder and Denver, Colorado. The solar arrays are located at the sites of two retired coal-fueled power
plants, on land planted with a seed mix to attract bees, butterflies and other beneficial species. In Colorado,
we utilize the Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s Best Management Practices for Solar Energy Development.
Our plans to establish the largest solar sites in Minnesota will provide beneficial habitat to native birds,
insects and other wildlife. Sherco Solar 1 and 2, under construction in Becker, Minnesota, will have capacity
for up to 460 megawatts of solar power on over 3,000 acres. Another 1,700 acres is in development as
Sherco Solar 3 near Clear Lake, Minnesota.
We will establish native and pollinator-friendly vegetation across these sites to qualify for the Minnesota
Habitat Friendly Solar Program. The project team is coordinating with multiple state agencies and native
plant specialists to prepare for implementation.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 49
High-Quality Carbon Offsets
One way we are addressing emissions from the natural gas side of our business is by investing in high-
quality carbon offsets. In 2023, we launched a pilot program with six local projects. To demonstrate the
strict criteria for these investments, we purchased only from projects registered on recognized carbon
offset registries with rigorous standards and long-term experience. Our partner organizations also provide
important environmental, economic and social benefits — beyond producing verified greenhouse gas
reductions — in the states we serve. This is another way we maximize synergies between climate and
biodiversity action.
The organizations (Bayfield Forestry Project, Ducks Unlimited May Ranch Preserve, Green Cities Accord,
National Indian Carbon Coalition, Refrigerants HFC Reclaim, Southern Plains Land Trust Raven’s Nest,
Heartland Ranch Preserves) are using the proceeds from the sale of carbon credits to replenish urban
tree canopy, reduce air and water pollution, conserve water, protect native species, restore grasslands
and preserve Indian land, all of which have biodiversity benefits. For example, Xcel Energy’s purchase
of offsets through Green Cities Accord resulted in nearly $37,000 going to the Minneapolis Park and
Recreation Board for continued planting and maintenance of urban trees and will support the planting
of nearly 300 trees, including over 20 species such as birch, cherry and hackberry.
Restoring the “American Serengeti”
Southern Plains Land Trust (SPLT), one of the recipients of our high-quality carbon offset purchases, is
focused on protecting and restoring grasslands for the benefit of native prairie flora and fauna. It is building
a climate-resilient future for this endangered ecosystem, which supports species such as bison, pronghorn
and prairie dogs.
By selling carbon credits, SPLT can purchase land in the Southern Plains and expand their over 60,000-acre
preserve network. Not only does the organization protect this land in perpetuity, but it also works to heal
it after decades of intensive agriculture. By restoring streams, letting bison roam, removing dangerous
fences and letting the grass recover from overgrazing, SPLT can turn the shortgrass prairie into a “major
carbon sponge.”
“Xcel Energy’s purchase of voluntary carbon offset credits helps us to make further strides for prairie
wildlife,” said SPLT assistant director Judith Westveer. “Funding land acquisition can be challenging, and
carbon dollars make a difference. We appreciate our partnership with Xcel Energy as we work to bring
back the American Serengeti across a vast prairie wilderness.”
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 50
Restoration of Operational Lands
We have initiated several projects to restore lands that currently or historically have hosted our operations
to create positive impacts on biodiversity. Our approach supports reestablishing native plants, vegetative
cover and habitats so that the land may exhibit qualities similar to its natural function prior to our use.
Pollinator Habitats
We support and initiate projects that make a difference in the survival of pollinators, such as the monarch
butterfly, rusty-patched bumblebee and Karner blue butterfly. Our 50-plus active sites cover 2,300 acres
of pollinator habitat at Colorado, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin company properties (e.g., under
transmission lines and around substations, generating plants, office buildings, community solar gardens
and wind projects). We have partnered with more than a dozen communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin
on projects as well as with federal and state wildlife agencies, conservation organizations and private
landowners.
In our vegetation management practices for controlling brush, trees and weeds, Xcel Energy and our
contractors do not use chemicals that are harmful to beneficial insects on our rights of way and
properties. We eliminated the use of neonicotinoids, which potentially impact bee populations.

Minnesota Valley Generating Plant
In 2009, we retired the Minnesota Valley Generating Plant, located on the banks of the Minnesota River
in Granite Falls, Minnesota. Site areas were decommissioned and closed in phases, the latest being the
demolition of the coal burning facility in 2022; an on-site landfill is being removed in 2024.
To backfill with clean soils and reestablish vegetation, we spread a native seed mix across approximately
nine acres. The mix, which was chosen in coordination with our consultant, Barr Engineering, and with
review and acceptance by Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, is like the native vegetation mix used
over the approximately 5-acre settling pond system area following its clean up and closure work in 2012.
Protecting Species of Concern
We work to protect species of special interest from potentially adverse impacts our operations may have.
Our approach aims to avoid, minimize and compensate for impacts. Centering on protected species, we
help reduce potential for extinction, benefiting biodiversity.
Avian and Bat Protection
Our Avian Protection Plans, developed with the FWS, help keep birds safe and meet federal wildlife
protection standards. We identified Xcel Energy facilities that pose higher risks for bird injuries or deaths
and retrofitted them with roosting deterrents, flight diverters that make lines more visible and other
protective equipment. Our facilities are designed to meet industry standards that prevent or reduce the
likelihood of avian incidents. We also require employees to use an online form to report injured birds or
fatalities. We monitor those locations and add avian controls as needed to reduce future risk.
Each of our wind farms has a site-specific Bird and Bat Conservation Strategy (BBCS), which is developed
in accordance with the FWS’s Land-Based Wind Energy Guidelines. The BBCS documents provide
guidance on mitigating risk to birds and bats during construction and operation of our wind farms and
incorporate a framework for complying with federal and state wildlife laws applicable to each site. Wind
farm staff receive annual training on implementation of the BBCS, including appropriate response and
reporting of wildlife incidents occurring on-site.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 51
We own several wind farms where risk factors require us to develop site-specific eagle conservation plans
with the FWS. They serve as supporting documents to incidental take permits that Xcel Energy holds,
which allow a limited amount of eagle collision mortality at permitted facilities. These permits require
rigorous eagle monitoring, regular coordination with the FWS and continued adaptive management to
reduce risk to eagles as much as possible. We apply a site-by-site approach to evaluating eagle risk. Before
construction, we conduct use and nest surveys to understand what eagles are doing at potential wind farm
sites. Results are used to adjust turbine siting and decide whether more risk minimization should be added
to a facility’s BBCS.
Once in operation, we evaluate how our projects affect wildlife. Coordinating with federal and state wildlife
agencies, we conduct post-construction avian and bat mortality monitoring at all our wind farm sites to
decide if we should make operational changes or take other measures. We also report avian and bat loss at
our facilities to these agencies under the terms of our federal and state permits.
Lesser Prairie Chicken Conservation
Rangelands in our Colorado, New Mexico and Texas service areas provide important habitat for the lesser
prairie chicken. Since 2014, we have spent more than $16 million on minimizing and mitigating impacts and
improving habitat for these birds.
• In March 2023, the FWS listed two distinct population segments of the species as threatened or
endangered under the Endangered Species Act. In advance of the decision, we worked with federal
and state officials to avoid, minimize and mitigate potential impacts from Colorado's Power Pathway
project in the eastern part of the state. After the listing decision, we have enrolled portions of the
transmission project in the Renewable (Wind and Solar) Energy, Power Line and Communication
Tower Habitat Conservation Plan for the lesser prairie chicken to offset any impacts to the bird's
habitat. Mitigation under the plan supports protecting and expanding existing strongholds and other
areas of relatively high-quality habitat to protect viable lesser prairie chicken populations and restore
unsuitable habitat.
• At Sagamore Wind Farm in eastern New Mexico, we committed to invest in over 2,000 acres
of preservation and restoration credits from the Lost Draw Conservation Bank — the first FWS-
sanctioned lesser prairie chicken conservation bank. With Xcel Energy as an anchor tenant, the
bank is working to expand, improve and protect significant high-quality habitat south of Sagamore.
Lost Draw partnered with a local ranching family to permanently protect and manage the property
— all while accommodating sustainable ranching operations. Through this partnership, Lost Draw
is restoring thousands of acres by reconverting agricultural fields and removing tall woody species,
such as mesquite. The bank is also eliminating existing fragmentation, such as pivot irrigation,
windmills and other tall structures, and will protect the conservation footprint for the lesser prairie
chicken through permanent easements held by a New Mexico land trust. The strategic location of
Lost Draw also contributes to the goal of securing a lesser prairie chicken stronghold and potentially
a future focal area.

Renewable Energy Wildlife Institute
As one of over 40 companies and organizations that support and partner with Renewable Energy Wildlife
Institute, we encourage the organization’s broader research on mitigating environmental challenges at wind
and solar energy projects and support the organization’s technology and research studies to help improve
monitoring and avoid or minimize impacts to birds, bats and other wildlife at wind and solar sites. Here
are a few examples of projects:
• Evaluating the impacts wind farm projects have on the displacement of lesser prairie
chicken populations.
• Evaluating the effect of wind turbine size on bird and bat mortalities.
• Understanding wildlife abundance and the use of utility-scale solar facilities in
agricultural environments.
Bird Cams and Nesting Boxes
With the 1989 installation of a peregrine falcon nest box at the Allen S. King Station near Bayport,
Minnesota, we were the first power company in the world to host birds of prey, according to our partners
at the Raptor Resource Project (RRP). With RRP’s help, Xcel Energy installed webcams that have broadcast
live nests since 1997 from plant locations in Colorado and Minnesota.
• Bird programs like ours were key to the peregrine falcon’s survival, thanks in part to nest boxes at
eight of our power plants including High Bridge, Allen S. King, Sherburne County and Riverside.
Through 2023, 444 peregrines have been born at Xcel Energy facilities since our nesting
program began.
• At the bald eagles’ nest at our Fort St. Vrain plant in Platteville, Colorado, two solar-powered cameras
allow viewers to observe the nest activities — in real time — such as the parents keeping the eggs
and eaglets warm, bringing home prey and fending off intruders. We’ve had cameras here since
2003, and a total of 48 eaglets have fledged at this location.
• Since we installed a nest box at Pawnee Station in Brush, Colorado, for American kestrels, four
chicks have hatched. We added a web cam in 2022.

Raptor Resource Project
RRP has partnered with Xcel Energy in raptor conservation efforts for more than 30 years. Power
production facilities were an integral part of reestablishing the Midwest U.S. peregrine falcon population
after the decimating effects of DDT, a synthetic insecticide that was banned in the U.S. in 1972, and
served as a recovery steppingstone in the early days of the project. Now, with healthy populations of both
urban and wild peregrine falcons, Xcel Energy continues their commitment to help monitor the recovered
population by dedicating resources to both monitoring programs and public education.
“Xcel Energy helped launch the first bald eagle camera in 2003, streaming the bald eagle lifecycle to the
public,” said John Howe, RRP's executive director. “Their commitment and support of the peregrine falcon
recovery effort and raptor education are commendable.”
Environmental Sustainability Grants
The Xcel Energy Foundation is also committed to protecting and preserving our natural resources. In 2023,
through our Environmental Sustainability focus area, we awarded $750,000 to 64 nonprofit organizations. In
addition to directly supporting the mission of these organizations, the investments will result in the planting
of 59,000 trees, offsetting 41,000 tons of carbon emissions. From the Mississippi Valley Conservancy in
Wisconsin and Great River Greening in Minnesota to HawkQuest in Colorado, the nonprofits span across
our service footprint, helping to conserve and protect a diverse geography of natural resources, native
habitats and species. Learn more in our Community Giving and Volunteerism brief.

Safety Always
Our Safety Always culture is achieving results. We launched this strategy in 2020 to focus efforts on
identifying the most serious risks inherent to our work and doing everything possible to mitigate them.
Research and best practices show this is more effective than traditional programs, which focus on
avoiding minor injuries to prevent more serious ones. Elements include:
• E nhanced culture: Safety Always is about listening and sharing with our employees and
contractors. Through Event Learning and candid conversations in a non-threatening environment,
we gain an understanding of how an incident occurred — rather than who was to blame — and
can identify and establish preventive measures. Due to its success, this process is used across
Xcel Energy for operational learning and improvement. We do not pursue discipline for employees
or contractors who report near misses; this allows us to learn at the best possible time: before an
injury. In 2023, near-miss situations reported by employees increased by 33% compared to 2022
near-miss submissions. Of these reported in 2023, 31% identified significant hazards that we
worked to prevent from reoccurring.
• D ata analytics: To analyze our safety program, we shifted from lagging injury data to leading
safety indicators that are predictive, proactive and supported by a centralized safety platform,
EcoOnline. These tools make it easier for employees to submit details about injuries, near
misses and observations so we can make more data-driven decisions.
34%
reduction in serious injuries
7%
reduction in severity of near-miss reports
11%
increase in safety crew observations
• Human and organizational performance principles: Five principles provide the foundation of
our Safety Always approach. We are incorporating them into our work, shifting our focus toward
ensuring positive outcomes. For example, we concentrate on what failed and why, rather than
who failed. The five principles are:
– Error is normal — people make mistakes.
– Learning and improving are vital.
– How you respond to failure matters.
– Blame fixes nothing.
– Context influences behavior.
• Event learnings from near-miss submissions: Since 2020, more than 440 Event Learnings
have been shared with all employees. In 2023, employees and contractors completed 58 Event
Learnings, resulting in 69 new safety controls for the prevention of life-altering and life-ending
events. We chose the Event Learnings from 432 near-miss submissions. Event Learnings are
initiated when the potential for a life-altering or life-ending event existed but did not occur and
when we think there is valuable learning as a result. By identifying and implementing safety
controls, near misses afford us the opportunity to learn how to prevent a similar event from
occurring in the future.
• Critical Risk Management (CRM): Under CRM, crews take time to consider the hazards involved
in their work that could lead to a serious injury or fatality, and they delay starting tasks until all
critical hazards are identified and all controls are in place. We have expanded training, monitoring
and evaluation to include employees and contractors, and we prequalify contract firms based on
their ability to meet our standards in 13 critical risk areas.
Safety Ownership by Operations
Strong ownership of safety by our Operations group drove positive safety performance in 2023. The
reduction in life-altering injuries is tied to taking personal responsibility for the safety of Operations crews
and colleagues. Operations staff, from the chief operations officer to frontline employees, take seriously
their contribution and impact on preventing life-altering and life-ending events.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 57
NOTEWORTHY
Energy Wheel Enhancement
In 2023, we launched two initiatives that focus on
preventing life-altering and life-ending events: CRM
and Energy Wheel Enhancement.
The Energy Wheel Enhancement provides an upgraded
worksite hazard identification tool and lists critical
hazards and their corresponding safety controls.
Research by the Construction Safety Research Alliance
shows hazard recognition conducted at the worksite
identifies only 45% of the hazards present. Improving
worksite hazard recognition is critical to the prevention
of life-altering or life-ending events. Enhancements
to the Energy Wheel helps employees increase the
degree to which worksite hazards are identified and
controls are implemented. They will be rolled out
enterprise-wide in 2024.
Office and Non-Operations Safety
We also apply the Safety Always principles to office workers. While the hazards they may experience at
work are typically not life-threatening, they can be life-altering. For example, they may experience tendon
and muscle tears from tripping or falling on the floor.
CRM
In 2023, we continued to identify critical controls. This effort is ongoing because processes, tools and
equipment change, introducing new hazards in which critical controls must be modified or newly created.
We formed a team of Operations and Safety personnel to evaluate work practices and ensure critical
controls are identified for work hazards and that existing controls are updated as needed. Crews across the
company have access to these tools for use during pre-job briefs to determine what controls are needed to
execute high-risk work safely.
Contractor Safety
In 2023, we continued meeting quarterly with our alliance of contractor partners — the top 15 contracting
firms that provide 55% of the total volume of work performed by our contingent workforce. For all
Xcel Energy contractors, we implemented CRM and Safety Always requirements into Veriforce compliance,
our third-party administrator responsible for contractor prequalification and vetting. This helps to reinforce
monthly reporting of their injuries and incidents, including significant injuries and fatalities (SIF injuries),
which is the Safety Always approach to monitoring severe events. They are contractually required in their
training and reporting to use Human and Organizational Performance principles, based on the tenet that it’s
less important to determine who failed than what failed and why.
We also implemented a contractor safety management system designed to manage contractor
performance, critical safety controls verification, event reporting, safety observations, near-miss
reporting, auditing and inspection, incident reporting and action tracking. Through increased field support
and visible leadership across the enterprise, Xcel Energy and our contractors work together to identify
and monitor leading indicators and safety metrics. To close visibility gaps in both directions and foster
better conversations, we developed dashboards that provide live safety data. Key elements of these
collaborations include touchpoints in the field with contractors and their leadership throughout the year.
This is not a top-down initiative imposed by Xcel Energy. Our contractor partners, instrumental in the daily
work of our electricity and natural gas operations, mutually want to strengthen safety partnerships and align
reporting, often to meet their own organizational goals.
We continue to work with other utilities and the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) to redefine contractor safety
programs that focus on the causes of significant injuries and have proposed our risk-based approach
as the utility industry standard for contractor safety management. We presented the contractor safety
management program during EEI’s 2024 spring conference in Baltimore, Maryland, for approval and
adoption as a baseline requirement for electric utility contractors.

Women Leading
Kim Randolph is an accomplished senior executive at Xcel Energy with a
career spanning 30 years in the petrochemical, natural gas, renewable energy
and power generation industries. Before becoming the vice president of
Conceptual Design and Planning under Xcel Energy’s Integrated Resource
Planning organization in 2022, she served as the vice president of Energy
Supply for nearly six years.
“As a female leader at Xcel Energy, my journey has been nothing short of
exhilarating,” she said. “Surrounded by supportive peers and inspired by
impactful role models, I’ve embraced every challenge as an opportunity for
growth. Spearheading innovative projects within the company has not only
pushed the boundaries of conventional thinking but has also propelled my
own professional development. Through perseverance and a commitment
to excellence, I’ve navigated through complex landscapes, contributing to
transformative changes within the energy sector while carving out my path
as a leader.”
Measuring Company Progress
We began including an incentive-based diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) metric to the annual corporate
scorecard in 2021, directly tying a portion of incentive pay to progress. This metric helps align and focus
our efforts, ensure accountability and reward success in building a more diverse and inclusive workplace.
In 2023, we reached our targets:
• Diverse interview panels: Panels of employees vary (e.g., race, color, ability, national origin, gender,
age, veteran status, diversity of background or experience). We extended 99% of employment offers
to candidates interviewed by diverse interview panels.
• Employee feedback: Six questions about workplace culture from our regular employee engagement
surveys make up our Inclusion Index, covering perceptions of work culture and how well the
company encourages authenticity, belonging, empowerment, recognition and speaking up.
• Executive sponsorships: To gain different perspectives and develop top talent, senior leaders are
matched with employees from different backgrounds. Since the program’s inception in 2021,
113 employees have participated, with 54 assuming new roles at Xcel Energy. Of those who changed
roles, 39% were female or ethnically diverse and were not identified as a high-potential employee.
Equal Employment, Anti-Discrimination and Pay Equity
Xcel Energy respects the right of all people to be treated ethically, with dignity and without discrimination.
We strive every day to demonstrate our commitment to those rights.
Equal Employment Opportunity Policy
Our continued success depends on the unified strengths of our employees. Our policy is to provide equal
opportunity in hiring, promotion and other terms and conditions of employment, without regard to race,
color, religion, creed, national origin, sex, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity,
genetic information or any other protected class status in accordance with applicable federal, state and
local laws. We seek to attract qualified job applicants and candidates who reflect the diversity of the
qualified labor market. We base our selection of successful candidates upon merit, qualifications and
other job-related criteria.

Anti-Discrimination, Human Rights, Pay Equity and the International Labour
Organization Conventions
We stand steadfast against racism, intolerance, discrimination and harassment, as stated in our Human
Rights Position Statement, which affirms our long-standing commitment to the advancement and
protection of human rights throughout our operations, consistent with the principles set forth in the
International Labour Organization Conventions and all U.S. human rights laws.
Our Code of Conduct applies to every employee and promotes inclusion, diversity and respect. It also
prohibits harassment, discrimination and retaliation against an employee who reports a violation or
suspected violation of the law, Code of Conduct or any other policy, participates in an investigation
or exercises any other lawful right.
Pay Equity Statement
Xcel Energy is committed to ensuring employees are paid fairly and equitably for similar or equal work.
Our compensation programs are driven by a pay for performance philosophy and routinely benchmarked
against the external market to ensure pay competitiveness. We seek to attract and retain employees with
a commitment to inclusion and diversity across all levels in the organization. Our internal policies and
practices are regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with equitable pay practices.
Workforce Diversity
We believe a diverse workforce is a key element to deliver value in the way we conduct business, in the
way we connect with our customers and how we build relationships in our communities. Because of this,
we conduct and invest in internal efforts toward advancing and increasing representation of employees of
different ages, genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, cultural backgrounds and education levels.

Culture of Inclusion
Creating and maintaining an inclusive culture for our employees is a top priority for our leaders across the
organization. We believe this commitment influences the service we provide customers, the experiences
of our employees and our work with communities, including suppliers and other partners. In addition to
enterprise-wide initiatives, different business areas continuously assess their progress toward inclusion
and diversity with the goal of identifying opportunities to drive change and support the company’s
commitment.
NOTEWORTHY
Power Up Program
We sponsor the Power Up initiative, a workforce development program that prepares underrepresented
populations for utility construction trade careers. Xcel Energy and the Minnesota Department of
Employment and Economic Development have partnered with seven organizations — Avivo, Building Strong
Communities, Career Solutions, Central Minnesota Jobs and Training, Emerge, Native Sun Community
Power Development and Summit Academy — to bring two cohorts of 80 people through this program. The
first cohort is demographically diverse and includes women, people of color, indigenous people and people
with disabilities — all from different economic backgrounds. The second cohort will begin in the fall of 2024.
In its first phase of deployment, the program prepares enrollees for unique and challenging careers by
teaching them skills such as interview techniques, resume writing and professional presence. It also offers
introductory tours of different jobsites and allows enrollees to experience a “day in the life” of energy
construction trade personnel.
Business Resource Groups
Our BRGs welcome diversity of thought, background, experiences, ethnicity and race, and provide
employees with an inclusive and supportive outlet for personal and professional growth. They also offer
opportunities for cultural exchange, community outreach and collaboration with leaders to solve business
challenges and achieve goals.
In 2023, we began a new model where one executive committee member and one senior leader sponsor
a BRG, assisting with alignment, credibility and visibility. Sponsors partner with BRG leadership to
facilitate strategic and directional alignment with the company’s vision, business goals and strategies,
drive accountability for the execution of strategy and plans, strive for making an impact, advocate
for transparency and help further the work of the BRG. The company has 13 BRGs, adding Young
Professionals Network in 2023:
• AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) Alliance • Tribal Wind
• ABLE (Accessibility, Be an Ally, Lead and Empower) • VETS (Veterans and Employees Together in Service)
• BLAX (Black Employees at Xcel Energy) • WIN (Women’s Interest Network)
• ECN (Employee Connection Network) • Xcelente
• GROW (Growth and Retention of Women) • XE WIN (Women in Nuclear)
• NAYGN (North American Young Generation in Nuclear) • YPN (Young Professionals Network)
• Pride Alliance
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 66
Military and Veteran Outreach
We are committed to supporting veterans and those currently serving in the National Guard or Reserves. In
2023, based on voluntary self-identification, 10% of our employees were veterans, and veterans made up
4.2% of our new hires.
We participate in the Hiring our Heroes Corporate Fellowship program. Our dedicated veteran liaison
assists with recruitment and retention efforts and, in conjunction with our Talent Acquisition team, attends
job fairs targeting the veteran community across our service area. Our VETS BRG recruits and mentors
veteran employees. In 2023, we were named a 5-Star Employer through the VETS Indexes Employer
Awards and recognized as a Military Times’ Best for Vets employer for the ninth consecutive year.
Xcel Energy is also a corporate partner for the Department of Defense SkillBridge program. Service members
may participate in a SkillBridge opportunity no earlier than 180 days prior to release from active duty. During
the program, service members keep the same pay and benefits until the internship concludes, while having
an opportunity to train and learn how their military acquired skills can translate into a civilian career.
Energy Careers Academy
To create a pipeline of trained candidates ready to fill job openings, we helped launch the Energy Careers
Academy in 2022 along with the Minnesota State Community and Technical College and Minnesota State
Energy Center of Excellence. The academy seeks to open doors to historically underserved populations
and prepare them for a career field that offers stable, well-paying jobs by providing training in electrical
linework and natural gas utility construction and service. This includes a nine-month electrical line worker
certification and six-month gas utility construction/service worker accredited training to create a diverse
pipeline for careers in these fields. Students receive hands-on instruction at our training facilities and
gain exposure to company employees and leaders, including hiring managers. Energy-related educational
programs are typically offered at technical schools in rural locations, but the academy aims to enroll
students in the Twin Cities area, helping remove a potential barrier for urban students. Minnesota State
and Technical College is responsible for curriculum, accreditation and instruction while the Minnesota
State Energy Center of Excellence provides general program support and oversight. The plan is to increase
program options, including higher-credit diploma programs.
The electrical line worker certificate program began in August 2022 and the gas worker training is expected
to begin in 2024. Financial aid is available through Pell Grants and other scholarship opportunities. Enrolled
students receive college and career readiness training and follow-up services throughout the program in
addition to regular interactions with recruiters and hiring leaders from Xcel Energy and other utilities. Prior
to graduation, students will be made aware of various job openings at Xcel Energy and other utilities and
supported throughout the application process.

Supplier Diversity
Our Supplier Diversity program supports local economies and
broadens our supplier base by giving diverse businesses an

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 70
We partner with schools and organizations to hire high school and college interns to build a more diverse
workforce and inclusive culture. In 2023, we attended 126 in-person career fairs and outreach events and
14 virtual events, reaching new markets and schools. We also interviewed 7,500 prospective employees
with an 85% acceptance rate from preferred candidates. External candidates filled more than 55% of our
open positions. To support our communities and reduce relocation costs, we focus our outreach on the
states we serve, and in 2023, 97% of new hires came from within those states.
Performance Feedback
Our performance management program, Connect 4 Performance, encourages frequent and meaningful
conversations with team members rather than traditional year-end annual reviews. Once a quarter,
employees and their leaders discuss successes, progress toward goals and professional development
plans, their work’s impact on the business and how it demonstrates company values; in 2023, 89% of
non-bargaining employees met with their leaders to discuss job performance and business objectives.
Incentives
• Through our Annual Incentive Plan, our pay-for-performance philosophy acknowledges team
members who go above and beyond with cash-based awards and other recognition.
• Year-End Awards reward exempt, non-bargaining employees who achieve individual and business
area goals and contribute to the company’s key performance indicators. For performance in 2023,
we budgeted merit increases for non-bargaining employees, giving leaders the ability to reward
employee performance and position within their pay ranges.
• Learn about our sustainability incentives and long-term executive compensation in our
Sustainability Governance and Stakeholder Engagement brief.
Continuous Learning
Learning Central, our online companywide hub, makes it easy for employees and contractors to access
e-learning, virtual and instructor-led resources. While training is required on topics such as safety, the Code
of Conduct and cybersecurity, we also offer multiple opportunities to support individual employee interests
and career development.
In early 2023, we expanded our offerings to Commercial Driver's License and crane licensing for field
employees who have job requirements for these certifications. The in-house offering increases student
experience and allows for more rapid skill development in these areas.
Full-time and part-time employees completed more than 600,000 hours of training in 2023, averaging 24
hours per employee.
• Internal training programs and learning opportunities:
− Nearly 18,000 resources and tools, including technical and computer application training,
professional and management training, safety and compliance-related classes.
− To sustain nuclear excellence, we provide classroom, simulator and on-the-job initial and refresher
training for 12 accredited programs offered through apprenticeships and the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
− For bargaining employees, we offer Line, Substation, Gas and Energy Supply initial on-the-job
apprenticeship programs and refresher skills training.
• Rotational career development assignments and higher education support:
− High-performing employees can expand their skills and knowledge and learn on the job through
cross-functional experiences. Employees view and pursue these opportunities through internal
job postings.
− We offer tuition reimbursement to all full-time and part-time non-bargaining employees and
to bargaining employees whose contracts provide for it. The program pays 80% of tuition for
qualifying courses in approved degree programs at accredited institutions, up to $5,250 per
year for full-time or $2,625 per year for part-time employees.
Strategic Workforce Planning
Employee turnover in 2023 was 14.8%, with approximately 38% due to retirements, 46% from
resignations and the remaining 16% for other reasons, such as unsatisfactory performance, misconduct,
severance or death. The Voluntary Retirement program had a significant impact on the increase in the
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 71
company’s retirement rate compared to prior years, accounting for 61% of all retirements in 2023. We
project approximately 19% of our workforce will be eligible to retire over the next five years and 31%
over the next 10 years. These projections are incorporated into our one-to-five-year workforce plans.
We take a data-driven approach to planning that ensures we have the right workforce size and skill set
to serve our customers, engage with our stakeholders, meet business objectives and manage potential
opportunities and risks. Our workforce plans are connected to and integrated with talent solutions and
business initiatives that enable our plans to be successful.
Senior leaders regularly receive Human Capital Reports that include employee demographics,
performance, headcount and attrition trends within each organization. To inform workforce planning
discussions, we perform companywide analyses that model the effects of different operational scenarios.
We also conduct annual talent reviews and comprehensive succession planning for key positions to
support business continuity and leadership development goals. Each business area analyzes its key jobs
and identifies potential successors based on long-term performance, leadership potential, skills and career
aspirations. We reviewed over 2,600 leaders and individual contributors in 2023, with 335 identified as
top talent candidates. This includes more than 170 potential qualified successors for 259 of our most
essential positions.
Just Transition
Under our clean energy plans, we are retiring coal operations ahead of schedule, which affects employees
who support those operations, along with the communities where they live and work. Xcel Energy is
committed to retaining talent and providing support to help employees prepare for other roles at
the company.
Our approach to a workforce just transition includes:
• Advanced notice: We make decisions and announce plant closures years ahead of retirement dates.
Employees working at the facilities are among the first to learn about closures, which gives them
time to plan for their futures.
• Regular communication with employees: Executive leaders and our union leaders partner and
conduct regular visits with all employees at our retiring plants. This provides an avenue to gather
employee feedback, allowing employees to gain greater insight into the transition process and into
jobs in other business areas to choose their desired career pathway. It also keeps workers informed
of clean energy transition progress.
• Career planning and opportunities: We offer on-the-job training, upskilling or reskilling
opportunities and tuition reimbursement. We give impacted employees time to explore potential
roles, work locations and new career tracks.
• Managing transitions: We work closely with bargaining unit management to help mitigate impacts
to pay or seniority when employees change roles.
We've closed 23 coal units without forced workforce reductions. On December 31, 2023, we closed Unit
2 at our Sherco coal plant in Becker, Minnesota. No workers were impacted; they were retained at the site
for ongoing operation of the remaining unit.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 72
Workforce Culture
We continue to cultivate a work environment that engages employees and encourages innovation, diversity
and inclusion. The right workforce culture is integral to achieving the company’s vision and strategic
priorities and goes hand-in-hand with our ability to attract, grow and retain the best talent.
DEI
We value diversity and recognize the importance of having a workforce that reflects all people. We
promote an inclusive culture — one that fosters collaboration between employees with different
backgrounds and experiences. Learn more in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion brief.
Employee Listening and Engagement
Since launching in 2019, our Employee Listening Initiative has included annual employee engagement
surveys plus feedback opportunities during onboarding for new employees and the exit process when
employees leave the company. All bargaining and non-bargaining and full-time and part-time employees,
as well as interns, are invited to participate.
The fall 2023 engagement survey had a 71% participation rate, generated feedback on 21 work culture
topics and received more than 26,000 written comments. Senior leadership commits to reviewing all
employee comments. The survey seeks to provide a clear and transparent view of our workplace culture.
We make companywide results available to all employees to show where we’re strong and where we need
to improve. Nearly 8,200 employees participated in the annual employee engagement survey. Engagement
dropped to 61, 13 points below benchmark. Participation decreased 3%.
Strengths: Opportunities for improvement:
• Safety • Barriers to execution
• Initiative • Well-being
• Leadership
The goal of our employee engagement survey is to listen and gather insights into how our teams are
functioning and address obstacles they face. We are implementing a plan to better understand and address
employee concerns, including barriers to execution, well-being, change adaptation and building employee
trust and confidence.
Holistic Well-Being Strategy
Our “Life Fully Powered” strategy allows employees to be their best selves at home, work and within the
community. This includes access to resources for physical, emotional and financial health, provided through
digital and virtual channels and in person, which allows employees to find the information and care that
best meets their needs.

• Volunteer Paid Time Off: Full-time bargaining and non-bargaining employees can take up to 40
hours each year to volunteer during business hours at eligible nonprofits or educational institutions.
• Military Time Away from Work: Enhanced policies for employees serving in the National Guard or
Reserves. While away, employees are paid the difference between their base pay and base military
pay for up to 24 months. They may also use 15 days of military leave during their mandatory two
weeks of annual training.
• Subsidized mass transit monthly passes: Discounted mass transit passes for employees in metro
Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul. Encouraging transit supports our goals to improve air quality and
reduce carbon emissions.
Flexible Solutions and Workspaces
Where job responsibilities allow, employees can work under our Hybrid Work policy, which requires all
employees to be on-site at their assigned workplace Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday each week.
Employees can choose to work from home or an alternative location on Mondays and Fridays. This model
respects our employees’ desire for increased workplace flexibility while fulfilling the company’s goal of
in-person collaboration. We have updated our Workspace Standards to reflect this new way of working
and continue to outfit new and renovated spaces with updated furniture that encourages collaboration,
flexibility and choice of work environment.
Culture of Respect and Freedom of Association
Xcel Energy is committed to upholding the human rights and ethical treatment of employees and
contractors. Part of living our core values means we treat others with respect, professionalism and dignity.
This includes maintaining a work environment free from harassment and discrimination or any other
unacceptable behavior.
Policies to Support Human Rights
Our Human Rights Position Statement confirms our long-standing commitment to the advancement
and protection of human rights, consistent with the general principles set forth in the International Labour
Organization conventions and all U.S. human rights laws. Among other things, the statement includes our
support of employees’ freedom of association. We expect all employees, suppliers and partners to abide
by our position.
Our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and Code of Conduct apply to all employees. Our Anti-
Retaliation Policy strictly prohibits retaliation against an employee who reports a violation or suspected

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 77
Our Responsibility to Customers
We operate under carefully regulated conditions*, determined in part by state commissions that approve
the rates, services and plans of utilities like ours. In exchange for the exclusive right to provide electricity
and natural gas service, we support the following regulatory compact:
• Duty to serve: We cannot pick and choose our customers, nor can we deny service. We will provide
service to any residence or business within our service area that requests it under reasonable terms
and conditions.
• Cost of service pricing: We cannot arbitrarily raise prices to levels beyond our costs. Pricing for our
services is regulated by the costs we incur to deliver them and subject to review by our regulators.
• Planning process: We undertake regular processes to determine the generation, transmission,
distribution and natural gas infrastructure we will need to serve customers. These plans must be
reviewed and approved by regulatory commissions. Stakeholders provide input on the plans through
a public process in most of our jurisdictions.
In return, we are granted the right to recover our costs and the ability to earn a reasonable rate of return.
This profit component is not guaranteed — regulators only give us the opportunity to earn it.
Customers had electricity service 99.98% and natural gas service nearly 100% of the time in 2023.
* We are required to regularly conduct a resource planning process, including electric and gas distribution systems in certain jurisdictions
and states. Generally, we file a proposed long-term resource plan with state regulators in which stakeholders evaluate and provide
input. The plans, which assess the overall power generating resources we need to serve customers, also include transmission
requirements and total energy load obligations. Once approved, we issue requests for proposals (generation only) if additional
resources are needed. As regulators review, we accept feedback from stakeholders and the public.
Affordable Energy
We’re committed to doing all we can to keep costs low, including adding more affordable renewable
energy, securing competitively priced fuel contracts and making our operations more efficient. Our goal
is to enable the clean energy transition while keeping customer bills low through initiatives including
conservation programs, cost controls, our One Xcel Energy Way lean management initiative, advanced
operational technologies for added efficiency and our Steel for Fuel strategy.
From 2014 to 2023, we kept residential electric bill growth to 1.8% per year and natural gas bill growth to
1.1% per year, both below the rate of inflation. Based on available U.S. Energy Information Administration,
the most recent year average residential electric bill for an Xcel Energy customer was 28% below the
national average. Xcel Energy residential customers' electric bills are also amongst the lowest in the country.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 78
We’ve also invested more than $2 billion over the past decade in a portfolio of renewable energy at prices
below the fossil-fuel alternative and conservation programs that provide customers with clean energy
options and help keep bills low.
Energy Assistance
In addition to our Personal Accounts department that assists customers with medical needs or are
struggling to pay their bill, we work with state and local agencies and nonprofits to advocate for
low-income customers. Our support includes:
• Public policy and advocacy supporting state and federal efforts to fund Low-Income Home
Energy Assistance Programs (LIHEAPs).
• Funding for state and local energy assistance agencies and weatherization programs.
• In-kind marketing and public relations to support energy assistance organizations and
advocates for customers in need.
• Encouraging customers to contribute to statewide fuel funds via their Xcel Energy bills.

We also encourage customers who may be faced with difficulties paying their bill to contact us to develop
a payment plan and see if additional assistance is available. In addition to LIHEAP, Xcel Energy has several
energy assistance programs for seniors or low-income customers with medical needs. In Colorado,
Minnesota and Michigan, we work with eligible customers to set their bills at affordable levels based on
their income and usage. Depending upon the program, we either match the remaining portion of their bills
or apply a monthly bill credit.
In 2023, Xcel Energy’s Personal Accounts department completed approximately 180 outreach campaigns,
completing more than 3.1 million touchpoints to customers eligible for energy assistance.
We only disconnect service as a last resort if we are unable to resolve the issue or arrange a payment plan.
When customers fall behind, we typically send a reminder notice 33 days after the unpaid bill is due and
a disconnection notice 64 days after the original due date. In 2023, we disconnected service to 52,555
residential customers, with service to about 87.14% of those customers reconnected within 30 days. Most
of these customers were reconnected within 72 hours of the disconnect after they arranged payment plans
or paid their bills in full. Heat-affected disconnections are not performed in our five Upper Midwest states
during the heating season.
Safe and Secure Energy
Our comprehensive outreach programs promote safe behavior among our customers, communities,
emergency responders and third-party workers. Our teams annually distribute thousands of safety
materials and use multiple channels (e.g., ads, direct mail, events, media, social media, sponsorships)
to communicate and share safety messages.
Public Safety Awareness
We run public safety campaigns on multiple topics, including four important message areas:
• Contacting 811 before digging.
• Staying at least 20 feet away from overhead electric lines and at least 30 feet away
from downed electric lines.
• Recognizing and responding to a possible natural gas leak.
• Keeping natural gas meters clear of snow and ice.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 79
In addition to sponsoring and participating in pipeline emergency responder meetings, we distribute safety
materials to excavators and to public and emergency officials. We also encourage specialized audiences to
use online resources, including:
• Responding to Utility Emergencies training information for firefighters and law enforcement.
We offer safety presentations and conduct drills for first responders.
• E-SMART Worker for contractors, agricultural workers and others who encounter power lines
or natural gas infrastructure as part of their jobs.
• E-SMART Kids for educators and students in Grades 2 through 6.
• Collaborative resources with the Pipeline Association for Public Awareness for public officials,
including emergency managers, city planning and permitting.
Natural Gas Safety
Third-party excavation damage to underground electric and natural gas facilities remains the biggest
threat to our natural gas distribution system and public safety. We belong to the Common Ground Alliance
(CGA), are members of one-call centers in states we serve and participate in the Damage Prevention
Institute (formerly the Gold Shovel Association) through CGA. We are also a member of the American
Gas Association and use their damage prevention performance metrics — under which our company has
achieved top-quartile performance.
We measure the occurrence of leaks on our system through annual inspections, day-to-day operations
and customer reports. We inspect one-third of the system each year, going beyond the regulatory
requirement of 20% annually. Identified leaks are prioritized for repair, from tightening joints to full-scale
pipe replacements.
Protecting and Supporting Customers
Providing safe, reliable service is a priority at Xcel Energy, and our natural gas
crews are a critical part of making that happen. Jake Warner, who has been a gas
emergency responder for 14 of his 21 years with Xcel Energy, understands the
importance of ensuring customers have a positive experience.
“As a gas emergency responder, I know that I am in the customer service
business,” he said. “In my mind, it is about the three Cs: calm, cool and collected.
If you’re not calm, you’ve missed the mark on providing good customer service in
an emergency situation. We cover all the bases to provide a sense of comfort to our
customers. Natural gas is a valuable service that heats our homes. At the end of the
day, it’s about ensuring our customers know that we’re here first and foremost to
protect their safety.”
Cybersecurity and Physical Security
Protecting our critical energy assets from all hazards is a responsibility that demands our constant vigilance
and a top priority for Xcel Energy. Electric utilitilties and other critical infrastructure owners and operators
face ever-evolving cybersecurity and physical security threats. We proactively engage with partners to
prevent, protect, defend and recover from potential cyberattacks and engage with our industry peers and
government partners to improve security awareness and develop solutions.
• To address increasing physical attacks on substations, we continue to enhance current physical
security protections and develop future hardening efforts.
• A cross-functional team is hardening our natural gas system against potential security threats.
• Our Corrective Action Program, a first-in-the-industry program, enables us to identify and remediate
issues across the company.
• Our programs help employees understand current threats, identify attempts to attack our systems
and contribute to our risk mitigation efforts.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 80
Our president, chairman and CEO is a member of the Electric Sector Coordinating Council, the principal

Natural Gas
We plan to invest more than $1 billion in projects that tighten and improve our system over the next five
years (2023 to 2027) after replacing more than 1,000 miles of pipe since 2012. All our transmission pipe is
now protected steel, and nearly all our distribution pipe is plastic or protected steel. We’ve replaced all cast-
iron pipes and have less than three miles of unprotected bare-steel distribution pipe remaining. By upgrading
and tightening our system, we not only help ensure public and employee safety but also reduce methane
emissions.

Natural gas is a flexible, efficient fuel for appliances used in the colder climates we serve. As we plan
toward our net-zero vision, we are evaluating opportunities for the system to support advanced
technologies and low-carbon fuel options such as recovered methane, renewable natural gas and
hydrogen. We are also evolving our natural gas planning processes to consider non-pipeline alternatives
and enhanced transparency, while continuing to serve our customers with the energy they need. For
instance, we’ve taken an innovative approach to addressing increased customer demand in our growing
mountain communities, working with a variety of partners in 2023 to identify new solutions for providing
safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy to our mountain system customers. Learn more about the
Mountain Energy Project on our website.

Advanced Grid Progress
Smart meters are part of the company’s Advanced Grid initiative, which helps ensure reliable, affordable,
secure electric service and enable more flexibility for customers. We have installed 2 million smart meters
in Minnesota, Colorado, Texas, Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota, reaching more than one half
of the company’s overall plan to install 3.9 million smart meters across all service territories. Smart meter
installation in Wisconsin launched in August 2023 and in North Dakota and South Dakota in January 2024.
Installations New Mexico will begin in the fall of 2024, followed by Michigan in 2025.
As soon as customers receive their new meters, they can access online tools, tips and their 15-minute
energy usage data every four hours in My Account, and by leveraging their Wi-Fi and grid edge technology
in the meters, they can access real-time information in My Energy Connection. A two-way field
communications network allows the smart meters and other smart devices on the grid to securely
send information to Xcel Energy. This allows customers to understand and adjust their usage and
allows Xcel Energy to respond to power outages more efficiently — improving reliability, reducing
outage restoration times and giving customers new ways to save energy and money.
Wildfire Mitigation
Over the last several years, Xcel Energy has seen increases in severe weather that affect our operations.
For that reason, the company is not only investing in the clean energy future; we are also working to
improve the resilience of our system today.
We are focused on resilience in many different areas of operations, but one is improving our ability
to respond to the threat of wildfires. Xcel Energy recognizes wildfires pose a significant threat to our
customers and communities. As part of our commitment to resilience and safety, we are making strategic
investments to support the power grid and build resilience to mitigate wildfire risk. We approach this
challenge from many angles, including system-hardening initiatives and inspections, operational and
situational awareness efforts and connecting with stakeholders — especially those in designated wildfire
risk zones — to understand the unique needs of each community. Since 2020, we have invested over $500
million in wildfire mitigation activities in Colorado alone.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 82
In 2023, Xcel Energy was selected for a $100 million award from the U.S. Department of Energy to
continue the company’s work to reduce and mitigate the evolving threat of wildfires and ensure the
resiliency of the grid through extreme weather. The funding, provided through the Grid Resilience and
Innovation Partnerships program and matched by a $140 million cost share provided by Xcel Energy, will
support a range of projects in Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico, Texas and Wisconsin. These projects
will allow us to expand our proactive wildfire mitigation work by:
• Adding fire-resistant coatings to wood poles.
• Improving equipment safety features in power lines and electric vehicle chargers
in high fire risk conditions.
• Moving certain high-risk distribution circuits underground.
• Enhancing vegetation management.
In 2023, we also expanded our network of early wildfire detection cameras to cover more than 1.5 million
acres in Colorado. The Pano Rapid Detect system integrates data sourced from state-of-the-art cameras,
geostationary satellites and other data feeds, 5G connectivity, artificial intelligence and cloud-based
software to actively monitor for smoke from new wildfire ignitions. These systems are deployed on high
vantage points and continuously scan the landscape using 360-degree, ultra-high-definition cameras and
artificial intelligence to spot, evaluate and signal wildfire activity within a 15-mile radius. As soon as an
incident is detected, a notification is sent to Xcel Energy and first responders, providing detailed visuals
and location triangulation.
Strategically placed camera deployments offer greater visibility for first responders in hard-to-monitor
terrain, providing critical early and real-time situational awareness when a wildfire ignites. With built-in
alerts and mobile notifications, first responders will always have up-to-date time-lapse imagery and key
information on fire location and movement — empowering them to coordinate a rapid response to wildfire
events with greater accuracy and control.
Our wildfire mitigation efforts will continue to evolve as we evaluate new technologies, complete more
inspections and studies and expand our collaboration with research institutions, national labs, neighboring
utilities and our communities to share lessons learned and best practices.
Vegetation Management
We use industry-best practices to manage millions of trees across more than 47,000 miles of
distribution right of way and more than 20,000 miles of transmission corridors, achieving our goals in
an environmentally sensitive, socially responsible and cost-effective manner. Integrated Vegetation
Management, a progressive system of information gathering, helps us develop compliant solutions for
controlling vegetation near electric and natural gas facilities. Some elements of our strategy include:
• Our pruning methods comply with standards set by the American National Standards Institute and
the Tree Care Industry Association, which are endorsed by the International Society of Arboriculture.
• All herbicide products are registered by the Environmental Protection Agency and the appropriate
state regulatory agency and applied by licensed applicators.
• In Colorado, our Mountain Hazard Tree program helps us stay ahead of tree mortality from the pine
bark beetle to minimize the risk of wildfire ignition.
• Our transmission line program emphasizes the removal of incompatible vegetation and supports
establishment of pollinator-friendly plant communities.
Our practices protect the natural environment and our customers’ need for reliable energy. We work with
landowners along our rights of way to decide if trees and other vegetation can be made compatible with
safety around our electric lines. For our distribution and transmission lines, work is generally performed on a
four- to five-year cycle. We also share information on sustainable landscaping and responsible tree planting.

Building the 21st-Century Economy
In March 2024, we announced a significant partnership with Meta, the parent company of Facebook, to
power its new data center in Rosemount, Minnesota. The 715,000-square foot facility, estimated to open in
late summer of 2025, will support Meta’s artificial intelligence workloads and connect people, communities
and businesses around the world. It will also represent an investment of more than $800 million in the local
economy, supporting approximately 1,000 jobs during construction and 100 jobs once completed. We will
bring energy upgrades, such as new transmission lines, to the site of the new data center in UMore Park.
The upgrades and extensions are paid for by Meta — not spread out as a cost to our other customers.
The Minnesota PUC approved the agreement between Xcel Energy and Meta to supply power to the site —
including a provision that Meta will contribute to our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, making
monthly contributions based on its energy use.
Public Outreach and Involvement
We actively encourage community participation as we plan and site our energy facilities, including
meaningful opportunities for people to contribute to energy decisions and investments that may impact
them. In addition to federal requirements, we follow the different permitting and approval processes of
the jurisdictions where we operate. For nearly all projects we undertake (e.g., wind farms, solar projects,
transmission lines, substations or natural gas facilities) we seek public involvement far beyond what state
and local jurisdictions require.
Depending on the project scope and location, we may engage with stakeholders at key points:
• S coping: Once a project need is identified, we research the location and gather information about
our system, property ownership, demographics, land use and environmental conditions. We
may conduct initial outreach and notifications to learn more about the area and begin discussing
the project’s purpose and schedule with community leaders, landowners, residents and other
stakeholders.
• Mapping and evaluating locations: We identify a study area and begin identifying potential
locations or routes for projects using field visits and one-on-one meetings with landowners,
jurisdictions and other stakeholders. Our goal is to gather input, identify issues and build trust.
We may host public open houses and work directly with local officials, tribes and other stakeholders.
We use this feedback to refine our plans and narrow the list to our primary or preferred locations
or routes. We may share our decisions with the public and seek additional input.
• Final routes or sites and permitting: We notify the public of our selected sites or routes and
submit land use permit applications or filings. Additional opportunities for public input depend on
each jurisdiction's permitting or regulatory process. We also purchase easements and may continue
working with communities on refinements or mitigation measures throughout construction.
We also keep people informed through direct mail, project websites, newsletters, fact sheets, project
hotlines and social media.
Partners in Energy
We help local governments and communities reach their sustainability or greenhouse gas reduction goals
through our Partners in Energy program by developing action plans in collaboration with local stakeholders
and officials. This includes:
• Identifying a community’s energy goals and developing customized plans to meet them.
• Raising awareness and increasing local participation in our conservation, electric vehicle (EV),
beneficial electrification, renewable choice and payment programs.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 86
• Providing tools and resources to help communities leverage opportunities like the Certified
Renewable Percentage, which lets them claim the full benefit of our increasingly clean energy
mix, and our rollout of residential smart meters.
Since the program began in 2014, we’ve worked with more than 50 community teams in Colorado,
more than 40 in Minnesota and six in Wisconsin.
Energy Future Collaborations
Through our Energy Future Collaborations (EFCs), we unite a community’s specific goals, such as
renewable energy and economic development, with our company’s services and expertise to achieve
shared objectives. This includes regular meetings with the city, council presentations, community and
stakeholder engagement, regional collaboration and unique ways to support public policy in alignment
with identified energy goals in the state legislature and at state regulatory commissions. The collaborations
address a wide range of priorities, such as:
• Advancing carbon reduction and renewable energy targets.
• Reducing a city’s carbon footprint.
• Maximizing energy efficiency programs.
• Ensuring affordable energy.
• Providing accessible EV charging for all residents.
• Supporting economic development.
• Integrating emerging energy-related technologies into area homes and businesses.
We have signed EFCs with eight Colorado communities and two Wisconsin communities, most recently
La Crosse, Wisconsin, in 2023 — all of which represent varied municipalities in our service area, from rural
to urban locations.

Inspiring STEM Careers
Xcel Energy fosters new avenues for Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM)
career recruitment, hiring, advancement and development. As a longtime partner
of Chippewa Valley Technical College (CVTC) in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, we made a
significant investment to create the new Power of Us scholarship, which will increase
the number of multicultural students in the electric and natural gas industry.
This year’s recipient is Matt Thoms, a part-Filipino Wisconsin resident who is
passionate about the energy industry. The scholarship will pay for the entirety of his
technical degree, including the cost of tuition, materials and fees associated with the
Electrical Power Distribution or Gas Utility Technician programs offered at CVTC.
“It’s an amazing opportunity to have with an employer that is dedicated to bringing
people into their industry. It is one of the places I hope to get into as a new lineman,”
Thoms said.
Karen Kohler, CVTC vice president of Institutional Advancement and executive director
of the CVTC Foundation, said the college and Xcel Energy have a long-standing

Employee Choice Grants
The Employee Choice Grants program invites employees to nominate a nonprofit to receive funding from
our foundation. An employee panel selects finalists that align with the company’s values and focus areas.
Then employees vote for winners in their states. The program has awarded nearly $350,000 to nonprofits
in our service area since 2015. In 2022, Employee Choice expanded from Colorado to include Wisconsin
and Michigan and in 2023, expanded to include all operating companies. Employees nominated nearly 400
nonprofits during the 2023 program, and nearly 1,200 employees voted.

Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management
Xcel Energy’s portfolio of electric and natural gas Demand Side Management (DSM) programs continue
to experience strong customer engagement and growth. DSM programs are utility programs tailored to
customers' needs and include monetary incentives and other support to encourage them to buy energy-
efficient equipment and/or receive lower prices if they agree to reduce their energy usage during peak
times of demand. Our 2023 results include:
$170.5M paid in customer rebates and other incentives
$283M total invested in DSM programs
7M completed energy-saving projects (5M electric projects and 2M natural
gas projects)
Approximately 1.3K gigawatt hours of electricity saved — enough to power more than
165K homes
2.1M dekatherms of natural gas saved — enough to fuel more than 28K
homes for a year
More than 620K tons carbon emissions avoided — equivalent to planting more
than 9M trees
Since 1992, when we began consistently tracking DSM program results, our customers have saved
enough energy to avoid building 28 average-size power plants. See all the ways we help customers save
on our website.
Programs
Many of the states where we operate have state-specific DSM programs regulated by their public utilities
commission, with different reporting standards and definitions. The overarching goal of these programs
is to help customers utilize and manage their energy consumption to save energy and lower their bills.
Empower Suite
Through a portfolio of integrated solutions, the Empower Suite offers customized programs to help
businesses be more efficient and resilient, meet sustainability goals and reduce costs.
Empower Resiliency: We launched Empower Resiliency in Wisconsin and Minnesota to provide
commercial and industrial customers with additional protection against potential power interruptions.
Some businesses have an exceptional need to always keep their operations running. Empower Resiliency
helps them prepare for the unexpected by installing customized microgrids or other resiliency solutions.
We are working to expand Empower Resiliency to support customers in more states.
Empower Facilities: Available for commercial and industrial customers in Minnesota and Colorado,
Empower Facilities delivers energy savings through upgraded energy-efficient systems. This turnkey
solution provides facility assessments, proposals and flexible funding options for how customers can

An Accessible, Sustainable Housing Community
As the first Net Zero Energy affordable housing community in the country, Hillcrest
Village in Northfield, Minnesota, is an innovative approach to the challenges of
the housing crisis and climate change. In addition to the Net Zero certification, the
property will be home to new solar panels in 2024. Once the installation is complete,
100% of the energy used on-site will be generated by an on-site solar field. For now,
each resident pays $20 per month for all electric and heat costs. Each unit uses 62%
less energy than other units on the market and will save about $1,300 a year
in energy costs. Any income from the project goes toward providing emergency
housing options.
Funded in part by Xcel Energy’s Efficient New Home Construction (ENHC) program,
the 17-unit, fully electric development was built to standards that exceed local energy
efficiency code requirements, maximizing cost savings and energy conservation. But
for residents like Katya Block and her son Cameron, the appeal of Hillcrest Village
comes down to something even simpler: It's home.
“It meant a lot to me to find a comfortable place for my son that’s also environmentally friendly,” Block said.
The homes were built with air-tight construction, cold climate air source heat pumps, high-efficiency electric
water heaters, extra insulation and thicker walls, triple pane windows and heat recovery ventilation. Building an
energy-efficient community like Hillcrest is costly. That’s why Xcel Energy provided a $250,000 rebate through
our ENHC program.
“Hillcrest Village is truly a model for how we can work with communities and partners to find innovative ways for
residents to use cleaner energy, be more energy efficient and save money," said Emmett Romine, Xcel Energy’s
vice president of Customer Energy & Transportation Solutions. “We are always looking for partners to make the
most of our existing energy programs and help us find new ways to meet our customers’ energy needs. Hillcrest
Village is a success story, and we’re proud of the partnerships that made it happen.”
Electric Vehicles
Our transportation electrification strategy addresses key customer barriers and facilitates EV adoption with
a strong emphasis on intuitive solutions, including greater customer understanding of their options and the
benefits of driving electric through education and advisory services, lower up-front costs through rebates
and other programs and incentives to charge at times when low-cost, low-carbon energy is more available,
typically overnight. This benefits the grid and lowers costs for EV drivers and all customers.
We continue to develop and roll out a portfolio of innovative pilots and programs that focus on four
main areas:
• Residential customers, including programs for multifamily buildings.
• Commercial and industrial customers, including fleets and workplace charging.
• Public charging, including transportation corridors.
• Innovation projects like electric school buses and vehicle-to-grid demonstrations.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 97
We offer advisory services along with programs for residential and commercial customers, plus
Xcel Energy-owned public charging and a portfolio of innovation projects across Colorado, Minnesota,
New Mexico and Wisconsin. From our flagship residential EV Accelerate at Home program and commercial
Fleet Electrification Advisory program to rebates for school districts and underserved communities, we are
helping customers save money and meet their sustainability goals. Learn more about our EV strategy in our

Renewable Choice Programs
Just as customers want more control over their energy use, they also want more choice in how it’s
produced. Our goal is to offer innovative solutions that enable our customers to meet their priorities around
clean energy and the environment while controlling the cost that all customers pay to support them.
In 2023, 300,000 customers participated in our renewable programs. Over 34,300 new customers joined
third-party programs that we support, such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens, nearly twice as
many as in 2022.
Renewable*Connect®
Renewable*Connect exemplifies innovation. We have combined customer input with our experience
to design the program so customers can fully retain the rights to renewable energy claims.
Renewable*Connect is self-supporting through subscription fees so nonparticipants do not pay more.
Through Renewable*Connect, our customers can choose to power their homes or businesses with up to
100% wind and solar energy. There is no equipment to install, and customers can remain on the program
if they move within our service area.
In 2023, we launched and fully subscribed our latest tranche of Renewable*Connect in Minnesota,
adding 200 megawatts of wind and solar capacity to the program. The popularity of Renewable*Connect
continues to thrive with program waitlists. We are working with stakeholders and regulators to further
expand program availability and options.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 98
Solar Programs
Solar*Rewards Community® in Colorado was one of the first community solar garden programs in the
nation. At the end of 2023, the program had approximately 150 megawatts of capacity from nearly 120
solar gardens. We’re developing an additional 8 megawatts, which will serve more income-qualified
customers, and we plan to add more solar gardens dedicated to income-qualified customers and
disproportionately impacted communities. There are more than 200 megawatts of community solar
gardens in progress in Colorado, including a portion that will have subscriptions dedicated to serving
income-qualified customers and disproportionately impacted communities.
Our Solar*Connect Community® program in Wisconsin is fully subscribed and delivers energy from
three solar garden projects in different parts of our service area: Ashland, Eau Claire and La Crosse.
Like Renewable*Connect, incremental costs are covered through subscription fees so nonparticipating
customers don’t pay extra to make the program available to others. In Minnesota, Solar*Rewards
Community is among the largest community solar programs in the country with over 890 megawatts
of capacity from more than 490 gardens at the end of 2023.
As customers continue to install more on-site solar, our popular Solar*Rewards incentive program helps
make their projects more affordable. Across all states, more than 23,100 on-site solar systems were
installed during 2023, adding 163 megawatts of distributed solar. We also greatly expanded our solar
incentives and options specifically for income-qualified customers or those located in disproportionately
impacted areas. By lowering the up-front costs of equipment or guaranteeing customer savings, we are
helping ensure renewable options help our customers who are struggling to make ends meet. Xcel Energy
won a Department of Energy 2023 Sunny Award for Equitable Community Solar for its own community
solar garden dedicated to 100% low- to moderate-income households in our Colorado service territory,
providing over 30% bill savings on average to subscribers.
Rebuilding Greener and Better
Xcel Energy worked with MIGIZI, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit that supports the
educational, social, economic and cultural development of American Indian youth,
through our Solar*Rewards program. In 2020, a fire that erupted during the civil
unrest following the murder of George Floyd destroyed MIGIZI’s former home.
When rebuilding, they decided to create a more sustainable facility. They did this by
participating in our solar rebate program, securing nearly $40,000 in rebates. They
also participated in the Minneapolis Green Cost Share program, which provided over
$12,000 in rebates.
“We’re trying to help lead the charge and be a model for ways that other
organizations can utilize resources to develop a more sustainable relationship with
energy,” said Mishaila Bowman, MIGIZI's marketing and communications manager.
“Our new solar array, which takes advantage of Xcel Energy’s Solar*Rewards
program for nonprofit organizations serving low-income clients, will provide clean,
affordable, renewable energy to the building. This is also consistent with our commitment to equity, sustainability
and building green tech career pathways for Native youth. It’s not just about being good relatives and caring for
our planet; it’s about empowering our Native youth to become the trailblazers of tomorrow while earning real-
world experience.”
The three solar arrays will also serve as a training ground for learning and building skills in solar, heat pump and air
chill cooling efficient systems, allowing MIGIZI to work with nearly 60 youth each year in green energy careers.
Our renewable choice programs reflect Xcel Energy’s commitment to meet our customers’ clean
energy interests. In addition to Renewable*Connect, Solar*Rewards and Solar*Connect, we also offer
Renewable*Connect Flex, Renewable Battery Connect and Net Metering.
• W indsource customers were transitioned in 2023 to the enhanced Renewable*Connect Flex; the
blend of wind and solar allows customers to diversify their energy mix and meet renewable energy
goals without upfront equipment installation costs.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 99
• R enewable Battery Connect allows customers to add an eligible solar-charged battery to their
home or small business, providing Xcel Energy access to automatically manage their battery during
periods of peak demand on the grid, and receive an upfront incentive.
• Net Metering offers an option in which eligible customers receive net energy metering benefits and
can claim Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) for renewable energy.
Program offerings vary by state. Learn more on our website.
Ski Resort Transitions to 100% Renewable Electricity
Our array of renewable energy programs allowed Arapahoe Basin (A-Basin), one of Colorado’s most recognized
ski resorts, to transition to 100% renewable electricity in 2023. A-Basin used our Certified Renewable
Percentage, Renewable*Connect and
Renewable*Connect Flex programs to source
100% of their electricity from renewable
sources. The resort also participates in our
Solar*Rewards program, with three on-site
arrays that contribute energy to the Certified
Renewable Percentage.
"We are excited to be sourcing all of our
electricity from renewable sources. So
many A-Basin projects benefit from utilizing
renewable electricity to make them go," said
Mike Nathan, A-Basin’s sustainability manager.
"I'm especially excited to continue growing
our electric vehicle charging infrastructure,
knowing that those guest trips to the ski area
are now 100% fueled by carbon-free, clean
electricity.”
Certified Renewable Percentage
In addition to renewable choices, we offer customers in Colorado, Minnesota and Wisconsin — and soon
New Mexico — a Certified Renewable Percentage to let them claim the full benefit of our increasingly
clean energy mix. We retire RECs beyond what is required to allow customers to have increasingly clean
energy. Customers automatically receive this benefit just by being an Xcel Energy customer, without
enrolling or subscribing to a program. Our commercial customers can include the Certified Renewable
Percentage in their renewable energy claims and reflect our clean energy mix in their sustainability
accounting or reporting. Learn more on our website.

strong leadership from Xcel Energy’s Board of Directors and executive management team, along with
business unit leaders across the company, we can effectively manage risks and opportunities and drive
strong performance across a spectrum oCf sluestaainnab ility issues.
Through our strategic planning process, thSe abofaerd and executive leadership team identified three strategic
priorities that represent the keys to our continued success and our vision to be the preferred and trusted

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 103
The chairman, president and CEO leads all aspects of our sustainability platform. The senior vice
president of Strategy and External Affairs and CSO reports to the chairman, president and CEO,
is responsible for sustainability policies, including management of climate-related risks and regular
discussions with the board, and works with teams across business areas that are accountable for
addressing related risks and opportunities. This report is also reviewed and approved by the senior
vice president of Strategy and External Affairs and CSO.
The Governance, Compensation and Nominating (GCN) Committee has primary board committee
responsibility for sustainability issues and risks. As part of its charter, the committee oversees policy,
adherence and disclosure regarding sustainability matters, including executive compensation, the
Code of Conduct and our Political Contributions, Lobbying and Government Communications Policy.
The GCN Committee receives a sustainability-specific briefing and reviews our workforce strategy
each year, including DEI initiatives.
The ONES Committee oversees our environmental strategy and performance, employee and contractor
safety, customer service and operational performance in delivering electricity and natural gas service. This
includes managing risks related to climate change, physical security, cybersecurity and public safety.
The full board addresses sustainability issues in the context of broader corporate strategy while two other
board committees have oversight responsibilities that include ESG topics. The Audit Committee oversees
corporate compliance related to ethics and business conduct and the Finance Committee oversees clean
energy investments, investor relations, affordability and financial health.
Executive Oversight and Management
The executive team is accountable for strategy execution, including sustainability initiatives.
• Each board committee has a coordinating officer, a senior executive who determines agendas and
supports the committee in carrying out its duties.
• Strategies and key initiatives are crafted and executed to strike a balance among reliability, resiliency,
affordability and environmental impact.
• Xcel Energy was among the first U.S. energy providers to tie environmental performance directly to
long-term executive compensation more than 15 years ago. Today, 30% of executives’ incentive pay
is tied to achieving short-term carbon reduction goals. Annual incentives are based on the corporate
scorecard, which aligns with sustainability issues, including safety, reliability, customer satisfaction,
wind generation availability and DEI progress.
Business Area Responsibilities
While the entire organization supports sustainability, specific business areas directly address targeted
opportunities. We use performance management and compensation design to propel our teams toward
successful execution.
• Strategy and External Affairs: sustainability strategy, governance and reporting, environmental
strategy and performance, energy and public policy, including political contribution disclosures, and
physical and cybersecurity.
• Risk, Audit and Financial Services: risk management, corporate auditing and supply chain
management.
• General Counsel and Compliance: corporate governance, disclosure and regulatory efforts that
support our goals as well as corporate policies, ethics and compliance, including Code of Conduct.
• O perations: power production, environmental performance and regulatory efforts that support
the clean energy transition, customer electricity and natural gas service, and safety, affordability,
reliability and resiliency.
• Integrated Systems Planning: long-term, coordinated planning for the natural gas system,
electric generation, and transmission and distribution systems.
• Customer Solutions and Care: energy efficiency and conservation, electrification and electric
vehicles, customer programs and satisfaction, and economic development.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 104
• Human Resources: workforce strategy and development, DEI initiatives, labor practices and
human rights, public and employee safety, the Xcel Energy Foundation, and employee wellness
and engagement programs.
• Financial Operations: capital project governance, compliance, budget and cost management,
affordability, investor relations and disclosure, and corporate development and innovation.
Operating Company Responsibilities
Teams at our four operating companies are embedded in our communities and implement strategies tied
to our sustainability initiatives. They frequently engage in their respective state regulatory processes with
public utilities commissions (PUCs) and policy processes with state and local governments to implement
strategic priorities. Across our eight states, these teams:
• Connect with local stakeholders to understand their perspectives, priorities and goals. They move
initiatives forward and address issues such as climate change, environmental justice, social equity
and the responsible transition away from coal.
• Design regulatory frameworks to meet the future needs of our customers, state and local
governments and other stakeholders, delivering cleaner energy while maintaining customer
affordability, safety, reliability and resiliency.
• Implement community giving and volunteer programs with local nonprofit organizations with a focus
on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) career pathways, environmental sustainability
and community vitality.
State PUC Oversight
Xcel Energy operates under regulated conditions, which are determined in part by state PUCs. These
agencies create the regulatory frameworks and requirements that govern our business operations with
the goal of ensuring our company provides reliable energy service while maintaining a fair and competitive
market. Regulatory approval is required for many of our major investments, including our work in our key
areas of sustainability, such as rates and affordability, equitable energy access requirements and clean
technology investments.
PUCs monitor our performance and enforce the regulatory requirements set as part of proceeding
agreements. To maintain regulatory compliance, we are required to submit filings and reports, such
as financial statements, operational proof points and other data that details our progress and work, to
commissions on a regular basis. Regulatory frameworks are not static, and we respond and react to
the continuously changing regulatory landscape.
Ongoing Stakeholder Engagement
We regularly engage with stakeholders to inform our business plans and seek opportunities to better
understand their interests, concerns and emerging needs. This ongoing collaboration is essential to how
we operate as a regulated and customer-focused provider of essential energy services. Through resource
planning and other regulatory proceedings, we have a built-in stakeholder engagement process as part of
our business model.
But our efforts extend beyond regulatory matters. We’ve established a strong local presence within each
state and community we serve. Our customer- and community-focused teams engage daily on important
service- and energy-related issues or projects with the stakeholder groups listed below.
• Customers: We connect with residential, business and wholesale customers through our contact
center, account management teams and personal account representatives for customers as well as
through customer research, communications, special events, meetings and the regulatory process in
our states.
• C ommunities: We engage through public and individual meetings, open houses and speaking
engagements, city, county and state government proceedings, membership in local economic and
community organizations, and work with community members on giving, sponsorship, board service
and volunteer programs.
• Legislators, regulators and policymakers: We gain insight into stakeholder priorities through local,
state and federal policy and legislative discussions and initiatives, speaking engagements, our employee
political action committees and regulatory reporting, filings and proceedings with state PUCs.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 105
• Investors: We regularly meet with investors to discuss and provide financial and sustainability-
related disclosures. This information is also made available through our investor website along
with quarterly earnings calls and the annual shareholder meeting. Finally, we access equity and
debt financing from investors to fund our clean energy transition plans.
• S uppliers: Through meetings, discussions and visits, we maintain relationships with key suppliers
and gain information through contracts and negotiations. We have set clear expectations about
business conduct and ethics through our Supplier Code of Conduct.
• E mployees: Through company, department and individual meetings, we share information and learn
what is on employees’ minds. We also use surveys, quarterly performance discussions, employee
communications, innovation challenges, our compliance hotline and bargaining unit negotiations and
communications (employees include union leadership).
Sustainability Materiality Assessment
To determine the highest priority topics to our stakeholders and continue building our company’s strategy
for sustainability, we performed a comprehensive sustainability materiality assessment in 2022. Xcel Energy
defines material issues with a double materiality lens. Such issues include impacts that the company has
on society and the impacts society has on the company. These issues reflect our most relevant risks or
opportunities to our company and our stakeholders. Our materiality assessment involved:
• Analyzing market trends, evaluating the landscape and benchmarking with peers.
• Interviewing key internal and external stakeholders and conducting an online survey to collect input
from a broader group.
• Scoring and prioritizing results and validating them through a workshop with leaders from
Xcel Energy and external organizations.
The assessment included more than 50 interviews with individuals representing key groups: Xcel Energy
senior leadership and management, our board of directors, investors, large customers, community leaders,
special interest groups and elected officials. An online survey produced responses from more than
200 Xcel Energy employees and external stakeholders.
We identified the 20 most relevant topics that could have inward and outward impacts on the company’s
operations and communities. The topics identified present significant internal and external impacts to
society and the environment, business operations and access to capital.
Nearly all the revised topics are familiar to Xcel Energy. The study results validated the relevance of most
of the areas in which we have previously focused. Our foremost priority continues to be leading the clean
energy transition without compromising reliability and affordability.
The study also confirmed we should continue addressing social issues, such as building a diverse and best-
in-class workforce and helping our communities thrive. We plan to conduct our materiality assessment once
every three years to keep our sustainability strategy congruent with our mission. Our materiality assessments
are signed off on by the senior vice president for Strategy and External Affairs and CSO.

Code of Conduct
The focus of Xcel Energy’s CCBC program is to Do What’s Right: Report What Seems Wrong. It
provides a management system aligned with this culture and applies to everyone at our company.
The board of directors reviews and approves the Code of Conduct. All employees are responsible for
understanding and adhering to the Code of Conduct and signing a statement of commitment. While
contract workers and suppliers are not obligated to take Code of Conduct training, they are required
to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, as specified in their contracts.
NOTEWORTHY
World’s Most Ethical Companies
For the fifth year in a row, Xcel Energy was named one of the World’s Most
Ethical Companies®. Ethisphere, a leader in defining and advancing the
standards of ethical business practices including sustainability, social issues
and governance, honored 136 global companies with this recognition.
The honorees demonstrate the link between values-based leadership and
business success. Ethisphere research shows that the “Ethics Index” of
honorees outperformed a comparable index of large-cap companies by
12.3 percentage points over the last five years.
Xcel Energy was one of five U.S.-based energy companies to make the
2024 World’s Most Ethical list and joins repeat winners like PepsiCo, Intel
and Medtronic.
Policies, Training and Communications
In 2023, all active employees completed annual Code of Conduct training, which had a heightened focus on
discrimination, harassment and other unacceptable behaviors, along with compliance resources available to
all. The course also educated on how to effectively respond, support and report as a bystander, described
how to recognize retaliation and emphasized our individual responsibility in fostering an inclusive culture
where all employees are treated with respect every day.
Regular, consistent communications on policies, values and expectations help us do what is right. To make
this a part of every employee’s day-to-day work experience, we rely on a wide range of channels, from
emails, news stories, videos and signage, to roadshows and in-person discussions.
In 2023, we resumed our in-person, investigator-led trainings for certain work groups. Furthermore, with
the creation of a dedicated policy manager on the compliance team, a renewed effort commenced in 2023
to ensure that every enterprise policy receives a subject matter expert review every two years.
Employees are responsible for complying with the Code of Conduct and other policies, laws, regulations
and expectations that govern our work. Training courses reinforce corporate policies and demonstrate to
employees how our values help them work safely and effectively, and ensure their actions will protect and
enhance the company’s brand and reputation.
Our conflict of interest processes reinforce our expectation of employees to be transparent in their
relationships and seek guidance to avoid and manage conflicts. In 2023, we expanded the scope of
those required disclosures to include all attorneys in the General Counsel organization. This disclosure
requirement ensures the company is aware of any potential conflict that may exist, such as family member
or close friend relationships, board participation, outside employment or having personal financial interest
in a company that does business with Xcel Energy.
Keeping policies updated to address changing requirements and emerging issues is another key
responsibility of the CCBC program. Our Policy on Policies provides the framework for establishing and
governing policies, identifies common written components to ensure consistency and clarity, and details
the process to adopt and approve enterprise-wide policies.

Employee Relations, Workforce Relations, Legal, Security and Audit. All reports are processed through
a case management system that provides the company with a comprehensive view of these cases.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 112
Investigations and Results
We received three reports per 100 employees in 2023. Over half of the reports fell under workplace
conduct, which includes harassment, discrimination and other unacceptable behaviors (such as bullying,
hazing and horseplay), as well as unprofessional conduct and unfair treatment. Case volume from 2020
through 2022 remained almost identical year over year; however, in 2023 it returned to pre-pandemic
levels. This increase also coincides with more days back in the office for many employees.
While the overall substantiation rate was nearly identical in 2022 and 2023, we saw an uptick in the
number of employee exits. Specifically, the number of terminations in 2023 increased by 73%. Overall,
over one-third of all investigations required corrective action, ranging from counseling to termination.
We remain committed to providing clear expectations of what we require from our employees and what
behaviors are simply not tolerated.
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption
Our work with global markets requires us to maintain high standards of business ethics and integrity
worldwide. Our Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Anti-Corruption Policy helps ensure compliance
by our employees and representatives with the FCPA and its underlying ethical principles. Our policy
includes commitments to:
• Abide by the laws of any country in which we do business.
• Make only permissible payments.
• Seek legal review for payments and contracts.
• Prohibit foreign political contributions and restrict donations to foreign-based charities.
• Accurately document all transactions with officials, customers and suppliers.
• Maintain internal systems and accounting controls that support compliance with the FCPA
and anti-corruption laws of other countries.
• Report violations of internal policy or the FCPA.
Xcel Energy’s FCPA Governance Committee oversees the anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance
program, annually reviews the company’s policies and practices and monitors external trends and best
practices. In 2023, there were no documented incidents or actions taken under the policy, and the
committee concluded the company’s program is strong, with low risk of violation.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 113
Enhanced Data Analytics
We use data analytics to prevent, detect and respond to misconduct. In 2023, we continued improving this
area, tracking potential areas of concern and providing leaders with a fuller snapshot of their organization's
mindsets and performance. We created dashboards covering business area investigations data and met
with select senior leaders to review case activity for their respective organizations. Our partnership with
Human Resources continued to strengthen as we ensured both teams were included in leader meetings
and dashboard reviews. We continue to mature our use of data by not only looking at case activity
dashboard trends, but also by viewing it more holistically with other initiatives occurring throughout
the company.
Per practice, we completed a compliance maturity assessment by business area and a cross-cutting risk
assessment for the third year in a row. This survey of leaders, whose role includes compliance, asked them
to rate 37 risk areas — including some that fell outside their area of expertise. The results identified and
prioritized current or future risks of legal or policy noncompliance, or ethical misconduct, that could lead to
fines or penalties, reputational damage or the shutdown of key businesses or facilities by regulators.

Policy Engagement
Federal Policy
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act (IIJA) of 2021
represent two of the most consequential federal investments in clean energy and climate in history. These
policies are anticipated to accelerate clean energy investments on a timeline and scale not seen before. In
previous years, we actively supported their passage through our company, advocacy, trade associations,
the Carbon-Free Technology Initiative and other initiatives.
We now turn our focus to implementation. Our goal is to maximize benefits for our customers and states.
We are actively pursuing applicable grant and tax opportunities while incorporating these opportunities
into our planning and programs for our customers. As the company continues its clean energy journey,
maximizing available funding will be crucial to support large-scale renewable energy buildout and develop
new clean energy technologies while keeping bills affordable for customers.
In total, the IRA provides roughly $370 billion in federal incentives designed to accelerate the clean energy
transition and keep climate targets within reach. Over the course of 2023, we engaged with federal and
state agencies to develop implementation rules for tax credits and other incentives and are pursuing the
funding made available by the IRA. Through these engagements, we:
• Advocated with Treasury through the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and American Clean Power (ACP)
for guidance on several IRA topics related to clean energy tax credits that will lower the cost of our
clean energy plans, including energy communities, domestic content and tax credit transferability.
• Implemented a program to accelerate tax credits monetization through the transferability provisions
included in the IRA and executed contracts to sell $400 million of tax credits.
• Leveraged IRA tax credit savings in our resource plans, which will result in over $14 billion in
estimated savings from new renewable resources.
• Engaged in rulemaking associated with the hydrogen production tax credit (45V) through EEI and
individually, which will support our hydrogen hub and pursuit of clean hydrogen.
• Worked with states and other stakeholders on implementation of home energy rebates for our
customers and shared information on stacking with utility rebates to maximize benefits.
• Leveraged an anticipated $30 million in IRA tax credits and rebates through our first Clean Heat
Plan in Colorado and Natural Gas Innovation Plan in Minnesota, making projects more affordable
for our customers.
• Engaged with the Colorado Energy Office and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, supporting
the pursuit of IRA Climate Pollution Reduction Grant funding.
• Engaged with the Zero Emissions Transportation Association for effective implementation of electric
vehicle (EV) programs and policies to ensure federal support continues to play a role in enabling
EV adoption nationwide, including in our service territory.
The IIJA provides historic levels of funding for clean energy, climate resilience and innovation. Xcel Energy
views the pursuit and successful receipt of IIJA funding as an important strategic initiative to advance our
system resiliency and emissions reduction objectives, while managing costs and risks of new projects.
We received award notices for Department of Energy funding (subject to ongoing negotiations) for five
applications totaling $1.564 billion, with up to $844 million allocated for use across our service territories.
Successful grant applications include:
• $925 million for the Heartland Hydrogen Hub to serve as a catalyst for a future hydrogen ecosystem
in the Upper Midwest, including up to $415 million for Xcel Energy projects.
• $464 million for two projects in the Joint Target Interconnection Queue, a first-of-its-kind
collaboration between two regional transmission organizations to construct high-voltage
transmission lines between Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest
Power Pool, including $115 million for Xcel Energy constructed projects.
• $100 million to mitigate the threat of wildfires and ensure the resiliency of the grid through
extreme weather.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 116
• $70 million to fund two long-duration energy storage systems at retiring coal plants
in Minnesota and Colorado.
• $5 million for efficiency upgrades completed at the Cabin Creek hydroelectric facility near
Georgetown, Colorado.
The company has also supported our stakeholders in applications to help secure funding for strategic clean
energy projects, such as EV charging. Through different funding opportunities enabled through the IIJA,
money has been awarded to entities working in our service areas that will support the buildout of public
charging to underserved areas:
• Nearly $5 million in funding was awarded to Boulder County to install charging stations in
low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, rural areas and neighborhoods with a high density of
multifamily housing.
• Working with the Native Sun Community Power Development, $6.7 million was awarded to fund
EV charging in the Upper Midwest along major transportation routes connecting tribal lands, with
Xcel Energy providing matching funds.
In 2024, we will continue to evaluate and compete for additional grant funding, including for transmission
and grid hardening projects. Learn more in the Affordable, Safe, Reliable and Resilient Energy and
Renewable Energy and Innovation briefs.

vision to deliver net-zero energy, including carbon-free electricity by 2050, with state policy goals and
initiatives as much as possible. Constructive policy is essential to driving the clean energy transition while
protecting energy reliability and customer affordability.
Colorado Legislation to Upgrade Distribution System, Provide Opportunities for New Electrification
Key legislation from Colorado's 2024 session included:
• Modernizing energy distribution systems (SB24-218): This bill provides and authorizes greater
recovery for electric utilities, including Xcel Energy, to upgrade their distribution systems to support
the achievement of the state’s beneficial and transportation electrification goals, grid decarbonization
goals, and federal, state, regional and local air quality targets. We will file plans to implement a
virtual power plant program, place certain distribution infrastructure underground and create new
interconnection options without requiring system upgrades.
• Local government utility relocation right-of-way (HB24-1266): This bill establishes the process
by which local governments and Xcel Energy coordinate on relocation work. It also requires local
governments and utility companies to coordinate on road improvement projects necessitating the
removal, relocation or alteration of utility lines in a local government's right-of-way and ensures cost
recovery for utility locates and provides clarity around responsibility when environmental hazards are
found in the right-of-way.
• Water conservation measures (SB24-197): This bill gives Xcel Energy the ability to safeguard its
water rights after the retirements of Craig and Hayden Generating Stations during the clean energy
transition planning period from 2030-2050 for use in the future if new technologies can be developed
in Northwest Colorado. It allows the company to retain the water to preserve economic development
options to benefit the region and potentially our customers in general.
Minnesota Legislation Supports Permitting Reforms, Grid Enhancements, Innovative Technologies
and Energy Efficiency Key legislation from Minnesota’s 2024 session, passed under Energy Omnibus Bill
(SF 4942), included:
• Permitting reforms: The legislature establishes the policy of the state is to locate larger electric
power facilities in an orderly manner, minimizing adverse human and environmental impact while
ensuring continuing system reliability and integrity. New provisions streamline state siting and
permitting processes for large energy facilities so that environmental review, public engagement and
approvals will be conducted in a timely manner. This policy supports the advancement of renewable
and clean energy, storage, transmission and other critical infrastructure.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 117
• Transmission and distribution upgrades: A provision of the Transportation, Housing, and Labor
Omnibus bill initiates efforts for utility distribution system upgrades to accelerate distributed
generation interconnections and authorizes cost sharing while another requires utilities to submit
transmission grid enhancing technology implementation plans to address congestion. These
provisions support our efforts to ensure our electric grid system can accommodate increasing
amounts of renewable energy and customer demand.
• Innovative technology: The legislature provides directive and funding for the state to conduct two
studies on emerging technologies: networked geothermal energy systems and CO2 pipelines. The
studies will evaluate technical and economic feasibility and regulatory analysis in partnership with
local governments, utilities and other stakeholders.
• Efficient buildings: The legislation provides updates to the state’s previous Energy Conservation
and Optimization Act to expand efficient fuel switching incentives for utilities. Additionally, efficiency
standards for building codes were also updated as part of the Transportation, Housing, and Labor
Omnibus bill.
New Mexico Furthers Clean Transportation Fuel and Certified Natural Gas Development
Key legislation from New Mexico’s 2024 session included:
• Clean transportation standard (HB 41): New legislation supports the creation of a clean fuel
market in the state by establishing targets to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels in
the state and forming a program where credits are created and traded based on the carbon intensity
of transportation fuel. This standard supports transportation electrification and the development of
other low-carbon fuels such as renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, biofuels and fuel cells.
• Funding for certified natural gas (CNG) study: The study establishes a state and industry
stakeholder working group process to evaluate the potential, supply and requirements to expand and
create a sustainable, market-based CNG program. CNG, also known as responsibly sourced gas or
differentiated natural gas, is produced following the best practices of methane reductions, leading to
the production and delivery of gas with a lower methane emissions rate than what otherwise would
be produced and sold. See how CNG is an important part of our net-zero vision for our natural gas
system in our Leading the Clean Energy Transition brief.
• T ax credits (HB 252): Multiple clean energy tax credits were included in the omnibus tax package,
including for clean transportation, energy storage systems, geothermal electricity generation and
geothermal heat pumps.
• Geothermal resources development (HB 91): This legislation creates a non-reverting geothermal
projects fund under the state Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department, which can
provide grants of up to $250,000 for studies of proposed geothermal projects, and grants for
financing such projects.
Engaging with Trade and Other Associations
We belong to major trade organizations for the electric and natural gas industries, other business and
industry associations. In addition to offering public policy leadership, business intelligence and topical
conferences, associations provide important government-industry coordination and keep us apprised of
developments in safety, security, grid reliability and customer care.
Our Strategy and External Affairs business area coordinates our participation, continuously monitoring the
positions and activities of our industry and other affiliations on important issues. Leaders and staff across
the company participate on boards, special committees and working groups that guide industry practices,
policies and positions. Hundreds of member companies comprise our trade associations, representing
different regions of the country and customer needs.
We recognize trade associations often reflect the consensus views of their members and that complete
alignment with our positions is rare. One of the most valuable aspects of our participation is a seat at the
table, which creates the opportunity to influence others on issues where we may not agree. For example,
in 2018 we became the first investor-owned utility to set a carbon-free goal and now 40 U.S. utilities have
followed suit with their own carbon reduction goals.
Xcel Energy supports public policies that create greenhouse gas emissions reductions while maintaining
safety and energy reliability and affordability for customers. We analyze policies and their alignment with
corporate, state and federal goals, recognizing potential reliability and cost impacts for customers.

Our relationships with suppliers are strategic and
• Supplier Diversity Program based on collaboration, transparency and a shared
• Human Rights Position Statement set of values.
• Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Brief
Like us, our suppliers are committed to supporting our communities
and the environment. We work closely with nearly 4,000 suppliers
to provide the goods and services to deliver safe, clean, reliable,
affordable energy to our customers.
We also continue to increase our partnerships with small businesses
and diverse suppliers, strengthening the environmental and social
criteria already embedded in our procurement processes.
Governance
The Operations, Nuclear, Environmental and Safety Committee of the board
of directors oversees all aspects of operations and operational performance,
including supply chain. Within Xcel Energy, the vice president of Supply
Chain is responsible for the company’s sourcing strategy and procuring
materials and services, under the oversight of the chief audit and financial
services officer, who reports to the CEO. Our Supplier Code of Conduct is
incorporated into our standard contract language and addresses expectations
regarding the environment, ethics and corruption, human rights, ethical
mineral sourcing, supplier diversity and safety. Just like our employee Code
of Conduct, the supplier code outlines requirements associated with our
core values and describes expectations around protecting human rights and
the environment and working ethically and safely.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 121
Supply Chain Process and Strategy
Our Supply Chain organization is responsible for all sourcing and procurement of goods and services and
management of materials and fleet. They negotiate contracts for everything — office supplies, contingent
staff, capital items for our generation and transmission assets — employing a systematic sourcing method
to deliver needed materials and services to the right place at the right time for the right price.
Four key business objectives, each associated with specific initiatives, drive our supply chain strategy:
• Maximizing investment yield.
• Achieving operational excellence.
• Managing risks and opportunities.
• Supporting community and environmental leadership.
Our spending falls into 35 categories, from meters and transformers to consulting services and marketing,
with over 800 subcategories used to determine risk opportunity and negotiation leverage with suppliers.
Risk Management
Our assessment and management of supply chain risk is wide-ranging, multipronged and aimed at
continuous improvement.
• Supplier qualification: We use services such as Dun & Bradstreet to monitor all active suppliers
for violations of Office of Foreign Assets Control, Excluded Parties List System and Occupational
Safety and Health Administration and Environmental Protection Agency standards, as well as criminal
proceedings and disaster events. We assess suppliers’ financial health, safety and use of diverse
subcontractors before contracting with them.
• Key risk assessments: We look periodically at categories such as commodity price risk, supply
continuity, quality and governance processes. We design sourcing strategies to minimize potential
supply disruptions due to extreme weather or other events.
• Global risk: Most of our spending is with American suppliers, but we also do significant work with
U.S.-based affiliates of foreign suppliers and a small amount of work directly with foreign suppliers.
Our Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Anti-Corruption Policy helps ensure compliance by our
employees and representatives with the FCPA and its underlying ethical principles.
• Security: Our Security Vendor Risk Assessment program focuses on exposure to cyber, information
and other security risks from suppliers’ access to our systems, confidential information and critical
infrastructure. This additional level of scrutiny involves a comprehensive test of the supplier’s security
environment by our Enterprise Security Services team.
• S afety: All suppliers that provide services or materials at our sites are required to submit their safety
programs and five years of safety-related performance data. Our third-party safety administrator
reviews this data and may reject a supplier or require a safety improvement plan. Once a contract
is implemented, we continue to monitor suppliers’ safety performance.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 122
Supplier Diversity Program
Our network of suppliers and contractors should reflect our communities and give everyone opportunities
to participate and prosper. We seek to do business with certified diverse suppliers, including companies
owned by minorities, LGBTQ+, disabled individuals, women, service-disabled veterans and veterans. We
also advocate for and partner with certified small businesses.
Xcel Energy’s supplier diversity policy develops and strengthens our relationships with diverse suppliers by:
• Conducting outreach to seek, identify and encourage supplier diversity in our procurement
processes.
• Facilitating alliances and partnerships.
• Educating businesses about our procurement and business processes.
• Identifying and encouraging subcontracting opportunities with major suppliers when direct
participation is not possible.

Over the past five years, we’ve spent over $5.7 billion with small and diverse suppliers, including
$1.3 billion in 2023, representing approximately 20% of total spending for the year on materials
and services. In addition, 63% of our supply chain spend was local.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 123
In 2023, we increased our supplier diversity goal to 25% of our spending on materials and services by
2025. We are continuously expanding our diverse supplier network to reflect our communities and increase
our economic reach, enhancing our program to make sure more diverse businesses can partner with us.
In addition, we are the first energy company to join top tier Fortune 500 companies pledging at least 15%
of U.S.-based contracting spending on outside goods and services from small and underserved businesses
in energy supply, distribution, transmission and clean energy.
A Shared Set of Values
Daniel Archuleta started Superior Underground in 2018 to make a difference
in the gas and electric utility space and the Denver, Colorado, community. The
company works with youth, from elementary to higher education, sponsoring
local programs and events that demonstrate their equipment operations and
explain their roles and responsibilities. They also sponsor school lunch programs
to alleviate the financial stress for local families and allow children to solely focus
on their education. But their work doesn’t stop there. Superior Underground also
believes in creating a work environment that promotes employee growth and
development.
Super Underground began as a subcontractor with Xcel Energy in 2018, then
became a Tier I (direct supplier) the following year. Our partnership demonstrates
a shared set of values, especially when it comes to being connected and
committed to the communities we serve.
“Xcel Energy has played a major role in the support they have given us from the very start,” said Archuleta.
“I have worked for Xcel Energy on the contractor side my entire professional career, and they have helped me
provide for my family, raising five boys all the way up to becoming a business owner. Their diversity programs
have not only helped my business but have also improved the lives of over 90 ethnically diverse employees at
Superior Underground.”

NOTEWORTHY
Economic Opportunity Coalition
The Economic Opportunity Coalition (EOC) is a nonpartisan historic effort to catalyze and align public and
private investments to accelerate inclusive economic growth. The corporations and foundations that are
members of the EOC have committed to aligning major investments in underserved communities with
investments led by Janet Yellen, Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and Wally Adeyemo,
Deputy Treasury Secretary. To achieve this goal, we continue to execute on our framework for excellence,
comprised of six pillars:
• L eadership engagement: through Xcel Energy leadership, reinforce and drive the message across
the business that supplier diversity aligns with the company’s values and commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI).
• Tier I and II opportunities: increase business opportunities with diverse suppliers through direct
Tier I participation and develop a robust Tier II program that identifies and expands subcontracting
opportunities with non-diverse prime contractors.
• D ata metrics: leverage technology to improve program management, execution, tracking
and reporting.
• Supplier development: implement a development and mentorship program to grow bench strength
and strategic partnerships in underrepresented categories.
• External engagement and partnerships: increase involvement with advocacy groups, communities
and government organizations to further our commitment to a supplier base that reflects the
communities we serve.
• Communication: build momentum by sharing our program highlights, progress and supplier success
stories internally and externally.
“As we transition toward a cleaner energy economy, it’s critical to not leave communities behind,” said Bob
Frenzel, chairman, president and CEO of Xcel Energy. “Xcel Energy is proud to lead the way among energy
companies in enhancing our supplier diversity commitment. We are joining the EOC to bolster a national
effort to support small and diverse-owned businesses.”
Our plan builds on ongoing commitments and past successes to take our Supplier Diversity program to the
next level.

Memberships
We are an active member of the Edison Electric Institute’s Supplier Diversity Best Practices Group and
participate in 22 national and regional business associations and chambers of commerce representing
Black, Asian, Hispanic, LGBTQ+, Native American, women, veteran and disabled business owners. Our
membership engagement includes board roles, working groups and committees, sponsorships and
attendance at national and regional networking events.
Strengthening Sustainability and Responsibility
Our suppliers are trusted partners who play a crucial role in Xcel Energy’s operations and our path to a
carbon-free future. To encourage suppliers to develop environmental commitments in line with our clean
energy vision and goals, we have included environmental expectations in our Supplier Code of Conduct.
We also introduced a set of questions in our supplier onboarding process to collect information on more
than 20 green business, product and real estate certifications, including LEED and Energy Star. In 2023,
over 670 new suppliers responded to these questions.
Also in 2023, we included Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) questions in the Supplier
Relationship Management survey, sent to suppliers that comprise 23% of our annual spend. The questions
addressed sustainability commitments, greenhouse gas inventories, ethical sourcing, health and safety, fair
labor, human rights, bribery and corruption policies, and performance.
In 2024, we will expand our supplier engagement to suppliers that constitute 70% of our annual spend.
This engagement will include training that will target strategic suppliers and provide tools and resources
for improvement, continued annual assessments as well as incorporating ESG questions in the request for
proposal process. Training will enable Xcel Energy to track and improve supplier performance, reducing our
carbon footprint and our ESG risk. Our goal is to reduce our supply chain emissions and risk through both
supplier collaboration and changes to the sourcing process.
