SUPPORTING PEOPLE To the Management of WestRock Company
AND COMMUNITIES We have reviewed WestRock Company’s (“WestRock”) accompanying schedules of selected sustainability indicators included in Appendix A (the “Subject
Matter”) for the reporting periods indicated in the table below, based on the criteria also set forth in Appendix A (the “Criteria”). WestRock’s management is
responsible for the Subject Matter based on the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.

DATA TABLE Schedule of Select Environmental Metrics For the year ended September 30, 2021
Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) AT-C section
105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform our
APPENDIX
review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be based on the Criteria.
A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter, obtaining an understanding of
the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the Subject Matter is based on the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express
such an opinion. A review also does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We
believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.
In performing our review, we have also complied with the independence and other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of Professional Conduct and
applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA.
The information included in WestRock’s Sustainability Report, other than the Subject Matter, has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our review
and, accordingly, we express no conclusion on it.
As described in Appendix A, the Subject Matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used
for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of
different measurement techniques may also vary.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying schedules of selected sustainability indicators
included in Appendix A for the reporting periods as indicated in the table above, in order for the schedules to be based on the Criteria.

DATA TABLE
APPENDIX
1 WestRock calculates its RIR by dividing the number of recordable work-related injuries by the number of total hours worked and multiplying the quotient by 200,000.
2 WestRock defines a "recordable event" as any occupational injury/illness that results in the following:
- Fatalities, regardless of the time between the injury and death, or the length of the illness; or
- Days away from work cases, other than fatalities; or
- Non-fatal cases without days away from work that:
o Result in transfer to another job or termination of employment
o Require medical treatment (other than first aid)
o Involve loss of consciousness
o Result in restriction of work or motion
3 Recordable incident rate was determined as of 04/22/2022, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The number of recordable incidents is based upon employees self-
reporting work-related injuries or illnesses which may be affected by culture, societal norms, and/or regulations. To the extent a recordable incident is not self-reported, it would
not be included in the recordable incident rate calculation.

risk) to 12 (highest risk). This allowed the company
to create an operation-specific human rights risk
assessment by country. For WestRock’s risk
assessment, the company chose a combined rating
of 6 or higher to be considered a high-risk country of
operation. This included countries that had a rating
in the 4th quartile (highest risk) in one index or were
rated in the 2nd quartile for all 3 indices.

11 WestRock calculates total weight in US tons of virgin wood fiber consumption. Virgin wood fiber is classified by WestRock as a raw material that is renewable in accordance with
the definition set forth in GRI Standard 301-1: material that is derived from plentiful resources that are quickly replenished by ecological cycles or agricultural processes, so
that the services provided by these and other linked resources are not endangered and remain available for the next generation. WestRock sums all mill consumption data that
meets the classification of virgin wood fiber for the reporting period.
12 To calculate the percentage of recycled materials used by WestRock to manufacture paperboard and containerboard, WestRock first measures the total recycled input materials
used during the reporting period. Recycled input materials can be classified as pre-consumer (i.e., paperboard or containerboard that is manufactured but does not ultimately
make it into a finished good delivered to customers) or post-consumer (i.e., materials that have been used by an end user or consumer, disposed of, and diverted from landfills).
To calculate total recycled input materials used during the reporting period, WestRock takes the unconverted tonnage (i.e., raw tonnage of recycled fiber weighed at the time of
purchase) of pre-consumer and post-consumer fiber and applies a conversion factor to account for weight lost during the manufacturing process. This final converted tonnage
for pre-consumer and post-consumer materials is summed to calculate total recycled input materials used during the reporting period. For the mills included in the calculation
of recycled materials used during the reporting period, WestRock also takes the unconverted tonnage of virgin wood fiber and applies a conversion factor to calculate total
converted virgin wood fiber used during the reporting period. To calculate the reported value, WestRock divides the total recycled input materials used during the reporting
period by the sum of total recycled input materials and converted virgin wood fiber used during the reporting period.
13 WestRock maintains operational control over a diverse portfolio of mills categorized based on the type of final product manufactured, including consumer mills, corrugated
mills, chip mills, and sawmills. As the percentage of recycled input materials used is specific to mills that procure and consume materials for the purpose of manufacturing
paperboard and containerboard, only consumer and corrugated mills are included in the reporting boundary.

and Baselining Guidance
14 WestRock’s accounting policy indicates that all renewable energy attributes generated by mills during the fiscal year and registered in a renewable energy market’s attribute
tracking system are treated as sold or available for sale and that WestRock will not be retiring the attributes to realize the underlying environmental benefits. As a result,
every MWh associated with the attributes generated and registered in an attribute tracking system will be treated as if WestRock had purchased that MWh from the grid
(“null power”), thereby classifying the electricity as a non-renewable energy source.
15 WestRock calculates purchased energy as “primary energy,” which includes the energy consumed by the reporting company as well as the energy required to produce and
transport to WestRock’s mills. Primary energy purchased is calculated using site energy (i.e., energy consumed at each WestRock mill) and applying a multiplier provided by
the DOE.
16 Purchased energy intensity (also referred to as purchased fuel efficiency) is calculated by dividing purchased energy for mills by tons of paperboard and containerboard
produced. Purchased energy includes purchased fuel (e.g., coal, natural gas), electricity, and steam for WestRock’s mills. Where mills generate excess electricity that is sold
back to the grid or another third party, WestRock deducts the amount of sold electricity against purchased electricity which is permissible according to the DOE guidance.

17 WestRock breaks out water withdrawal into three applicable categories outlined in GRI Standard 303-3: surface water, groundwater, and third-party water.
18 WestRock mill managers primarily rely on the use of company-owned flow meter equipment to capture daily water withdrawal volumes, which are aggregated over the reporting
period for external reporting. As recommended by management, mills calibrate flow meters regularly (i.e., at least annually) to confirm the accurate measurement of water
withdrawal volumes.

20 WestRock owns and operates landfills which are located onsite or in close proximity to WestRock’s paper mills. EPA calculation methodologies (and other publicly available
estimation methodologies) may not be representative of actual fugitive methane emissions from pulp and paper industry landfills. As such, management has elected to exclude
fugitive methane emissions from company-owned landfills from its reporting boundary, which is permissible according to The GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting
Standard.
21 WestRock applies The GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance for market-based emissions by multiplying purchased electricity and steam by the emissions factors indicated in the table
in the notes section titled “Sources of emissions factors and global warming potentials.” For some WestRock owned mills, renewable energy attributes are generated from the
stationary combustion of biofuels. Where these attributes are unbundled and registered in an energy market’s attribute tracking system, the company adjusts its Scope 2 MBM
emissions as recommended by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance by treating the underlying power associated with the attributes as if it were purchased from the grid and
multiplying the power by the corresponding emissions factors.
22 WestRock calculates emissions intensity as the total Scope 1 emissions from combustion sources (i.e., excluding fugitive methane emissions from company-owned landfills)
and total Scope 2 MBM emissions divided by tons of paperboard and containerboard produced.
