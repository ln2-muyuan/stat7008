for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2023 and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual results to differ materially
from management expectations as suggested by such forward-looking information: operational safety, including our nuclear generation facilities and other
utility operations; successful long-term operational planning; commodity risks associated with energy markets and production; rising energy prices and fuel
costs; qualified employee workforce and third-party contractor factors; violations of our Codes of Conduct; our ability to recover costs and our subsidiaries’
ability to recover costs from customers; changes in regulation; reductions in our credit ratings and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships;
general economic conditions, including recessionary conditions, inflation rates, monetary fluctuations, supply chain constraints and their impact on capital
expenditures and/or the ability of Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms; availability or cost of capital; our customers’ and
counterparties’ ability to pay their debts to us; assumptions and costs relating to funding our employee benefit plans and health care benefits; our subsidiaries’
ability to make dividend payments; tax laws; uncertainty regarding epidemics, the duration and magnitude of business restrictions including shutdowns
(domestically and globally), the potential impact on the workforce, including shortages of employees or third-party contractors due to quarantine policies,
vaccination requirements or government restrictions, impacts on the transportation of goods and the generalized impact on the economy; effects of
geopolitical events, including war and acts of terrorism; cybersecurity threats and data security breaches; seasonal weather patterns; changes in
environmental laws and regulations; climate change and other weather events; natural disasters and resource depletion, including compliance with any
accompanying legislative and regulatory changes; costs of potential regulatory penalties and wildfire damages in excess of liability insurance coverage;
regulatory changes and/or limitations related to the use of natural gas as an energy source; challenging labor market conditions and our ability to attract and
retain a qualified workforce; and our ability to execute on our strategies or achieve expectations related to environmental, social and governance matters
including as a result of evolving legal, regulatory and other standards, processes, and assumptions, the pace of scientific and technological developments,
increased costs, the availability of requisite financing, and changes in carbon markets.
