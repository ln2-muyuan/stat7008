Trojan Technologies Makes
Impressive Water Savings at
London, Ontario Site
Two improvement initiatives imple-
mented during the second half of
2020 have resulted in significant
and sustained water savings at the
Trojan Technologies site in London,
Ontario. The first initiative was a
change in manufacturing process
that removed a redundant test-
ing step which saved 2,500 cubic
meters of water usage annually.
The second initiative was related
to a closed loop cooling tower
upgrade. The previous site cooling
tower was unable to efficiently
meet the process requirements
which led to high water consump-
tion rates. Installation of a new,
higher efficiency cooling tower
further reduced annual water con-
sumption by 8,000 cubic meters.
10,500

*In anticipation of our separation from our former parent company, Veralto undertook a program in 2023 to establish a new Greenhouse Gas Emissions inventory that more fully captured our scope of operations. As a result, we have increased our scope of reporting for energy
consumption and GHG emissions to include approximately 95% of our global real estate footprint by area, an increase from approximately 70% in 2022’s reporting. We have begun assessing scope 3 GHG emissions and we are working to expand these reporting activities over time.
