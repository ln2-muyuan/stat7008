A letter
from the CEO
At Wells Fargo, we believe that to be successful
as a company, we must consider a broad set of
stakeholders in our decisions and actions, beyond
shareholders. This is not in lieu of shareholders —
in fact, we believe a broader focus will enhance our
returns to shareholders over time. Consumers and
businesses want to do business with a company
that actively supports employees, customers, and
communities — especially those most in need.
In the pages that follow, you’ll find an overview of
the environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
work underway at Wells Fargo. This includes the
work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive
future in the communities we serve. These efforts
span housing affordability, small business growth,
financial inclusion, addressing climate change, and
other initiatives.
We consider this work a sustained, long-term
commitment. We know that there is much work
to do, and Wells Fargo is well-positioned to make
a difference.

Wells Fargo’s
key ESG themes
& focus areas
As a leading financial services company, Wells Fargo
believes that it has a role to play in addressing
social, economic, and environmental sustainability,
and the company is committed to sound and
effective corporate governance practices. The
company continues to take an active role in
addressing pressing societal challenges to drive
positive impact.
Wells Fargo regularly assesses ESG and
sustainability themes and focus areas that it
believes are most relevant to the company and its
stakeholders. The company monitors ESG trends,
and has periodically engaged with stakeholders to
identify top-of-mind ESG themes, which inform
its strategies, goals, and reporting priorities. With
those topics in mind, Wells Fargo continues to work
to make meaningful progress with respect to these
pressing ESG challenges.

Wells Fargo focuses its work on three sustainability-related areas
of critical importance.
Environmental sustainability
Wells Fargo believes that climate change is one of the most urgent environmental
and social issues of our time. That is why in March 2021, Wells Fargo announced its
effort to support the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting a goal of net-zero
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In 2021, the bank also joined the Net-Zero Banking
Alliance, an industry leadership group focused on implementing climate targets. In
furtherance of this net-zero goal, in May 2022, the company published the Wells Fargo
CO2eMissionSM, a climate alignment and target-setting methodology for its financing
portfolios, and set its first interim financed emissions targets for two high-emitting
sectors (Oil & Gas and Power). In 2021, the company also launched an Institute for
Sustainable Finance to deploy $500 billion of financing to sustainable businesses and
projects by 2030, as well as to support science-based research on low-carbon solutions,
and advocate for policies that enable client transitions.
Social impact
Wells Fargo seeks to support a more sustainable and equitable economy by
opening pathways to economic advancement, championing quality affordable
homes, empowering small business growth, and enabling a low-carbon economy.
Through these and other efforts, the company hopes to help build wealth, enhance
economic mobility, and strengthen diverse and historically marginalized communities.
In collaboration with community organizations, civic leaders, and nonprofits at the
local, state, and national levels, Wells Fargo is working to address systemic barriers to
financial inclusion and opportunity. Wells Fargo’s resources and expertise can make a
positive impact in communities, addressing these complex societal issues to help build
a more sustainable, equitable future for all.
Diversity, equity, and inclusion
Wells Fargo is dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The company is focused
on increasing diverse representation at all levels, creating a more inclusive
workplace, and better serving and growing its diverse customer segments and
diverse suppliers across all lines of business. This approach is embedded in the
company’s culture and business practices, products and services, and philanthropic
giving. Additional details are discussed in the 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Report (PDF).
As Wells Fargo continues its work on key ESG themes, the company recognizes that its employees, culture,
and governance are all critical ingredients for making meaningful progress.

Wells Fargo calculates its operational Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse
Gas Protocol. Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that
are controlled or owned by an organization. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with
the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling, and are a result of the organization’s energy use.

*Wells Fargo's environmental data included in the Statements of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions has been reviewed by an independent
third-party accountant for the year ended December 31, 2021.
1. MTCO2e stands for metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent.
2. Wells Fargo has purchased carbon offsets to achieve carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since 2019.
3. A location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using grid-
average emission factor data). A market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that Wells Fargo has purposefully
chosen. It derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for
the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims.
4. Total Scope 1 emissions in 2019 and 2020 have been restated to reflect a correction to the emissions calculation for
stationary combustion.

1. MTCO2e stands for metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent.
2. In 2020, Scope 3, Category 1 and Category 2 emissions reporting transitioned to USEEIO 1.0 emissions factors from previously
utilized UK DEFRA emissions factors. This methodology change resulted in a large decrease in emissions. In 2021, USEEIO 1.1
emission factors were applied resulting in additional accounting refinements.
3. Categories listed above as "not relevant" or "relevant, not calculated" include activities that were not yet calculated, not

Growing the renewable
energy supply
Consistent with the company's climate and sustainability goals, Wells Fargo is committed to supporting
the development of new sources of renewable energy. Through the end of 2021, Wells Fargo contracted for
210 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy generation across 13 states and three countries, supporting
new job creation and creating resilient communities.

Notes
1. Self-supply is when a consumer generates and supplies their own electricity. Wells Fargo’s self-supply refers to its on-site solar program.
2. Physical power purchase agreements are contracts for the purchase of power and associated Renewable Energy Certificates
from a specific renewable energy generator (the seller) to a purchaser of renewable electricity (the buyer).
3. Wells Fargo met 100% of its electricity consumption with renewable energy, primarily from unbundled Renewable Energy
Certificates beginning in 2017. Its goal is to transition to long-term agreements (defined as contracts with a duration of five years
or longer) that directly support new sources of renewable energy. New sources of renewable energy are defined as assets where
commercial operation was achieved no earlier than 12 months prior to contract execution.
4. Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates are sold, delivered, or purchased separately from the electricity generated by the
renewable resource.
5. This data includes cumulative new renewable energy generation capacity contracted by Wells Fargo. Some assets have not yet
achieved commercial operation and are under construction.

Notes
1. Wells Fargo encourages its suppliers to demonstrate their commitment to environmental sustainability by participating in the CDP
survey. The suppliers were selected to participate using a methodology that considered each supplier’s spend, operational criticality to
Wells Fargo, and whether the supplier is in a carbon-intensive industry. As a result, the majority of participating suppliers represent high
spend and/or high criticality with many in high-carbon industries.

Examples of Wells Fargo’s housing affordability
philanthropy initiatives include:
• Through the Wells Fargo Builds program, in
collaboration with Habitat for Humanity and
Rebuilding Together, Wells Fargo funded more
than 482 home build projects across the U.S.
in 2021. This funding of affordable and sustainable
housing includes support for new home
construction and repairs, helping older adults age
in their homes, and neighborhood revitalization.
• Through Wells Fargo's NeighborhoodLIFT®
program, the company collaborates with
NeighborWorks® America and local nonprofits
to support sustainable homeownership by
delivering down payment assistance to low-
and moderate-income homebuyers. This
program supports individuals, both customers
and noncustomers, in a number of communities
throughout the U.S. While the LIFT program is
focused on serving low- and moderate-income
families regardless of race or ethnicity, the
majority of LIFT homeowners represent those
who identify as Black and African American,
Indigenous, and people of color.

teamwork is rewarded; everyone feels respected
and empowered to speak up; diversity, equity, and
inclusion are embraced; and how work gets done is
just as important as getting the work done.
Culture
Wells Fargo is committed to a culture that attracts
and retains the best people who help it become
a better, stronger company. The company's
culture is reinforced by a customer-centric
focus, employee engagement and feedback,
and expectations that guide how employees
conduct themselves, work with customers

service of its customers and stakeholders.

Wells Fargo continues to refine its culture, instilling efficiency and effectiveness throughout, leveraging
employee feedback to enhance the employee experience and drive improvements. Throughout the year,
employees are invited to share their thoughts through surveys, town halls, and other means. Wells Fargo
launched a new company-wide employee feedback platform called Loudspeaker at the end of 2021.
Employees have submitted thousands of ideas, some of which have been implemented, leading to
efficiencies, innovation, and employee engagement.
Competitive compensation
Wells Fargo's compensation program is linked to performance management and is designed to promote
prudent risk management and reinforce its culture and operating standards:
The compensation principles include:
Pay for performance: Compensation is linked to company, line of business, and
individual performance, including meeting regulatory expectations and creating long-
term value consistent with the interests of shareholders.
Promote effective risk management: Compensation promotes effective risk
management and discourages imprudent or excessive risk-taking.
Attract and retain talent: People are one of Wells Fargo's competitive advantages;
therefore, compensation helps attract, motivate, and retain people with the skills,
talent, and experience to drive superior long-term company performance.
The company is committed to providing fair, competitive, and equitable compensation. In November 2021,
Wells Fargo announced an increase in its U.S. minimum hourly base pay in the majority of its markets. The
minimum hourly pay range in the U.S. is $18 to $22, based on the cost of labor in each Wells Fargo market.
Pay equity review
Wells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices, and we regularly review our
compensation programs and practices for pay equity. Each year, the company engages a third-party
consultant to conduct a thorough pay equity review of employee compensation, which considers gender, race,
and ethnicity. The results of the 2021 review, after accounting for factors such as role, tenure, and geography,
show that women at Wells Fargo continued to earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by their male
peers. In addition, U.S. employees of color continue to earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by white
peers. The results of Wells Fargo’s most recent pay equity analysis and relevant commentary are available in
the company’s 2022 Proxy Statement.
