Message from CEO
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions are calculated using methodologies consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard. Our disclosures are also aligned with the recommendation of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) that organizations disclose “Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions,
and the related risks.” The Company has disclosed Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions totals based on an operational control approach to

About this Report
Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the Company. Local regulatory programs were
applicable to all facilities included in the Company’s Scope 1 emissions inventory in 2022. A local regulatory program in this context refers
to any scheme requiring emissions to be calculated using mandated references or mandated factors (e.g., US GHGRP which publish factors
specific to the programs). Scope 1 emissions do not include CO2 used as feedstock in on-site upgrade processes such as in urea production, as
those emissions are included in Scope 3.
Company
Background CF Industries’ GHG Emissions (Scope 1 and 2) are related directly to production, and therefore the primary target for GHG reduction is intensity-
& Strategy based. Specifically, the chosen metric is the Scope 1 (direct) GHG Emissions divided by the total Ammonia production in the relevant year. An
improvement of 25% by 2030 is the company goal, based on a reference year of 2015. Additionally, CF Industries began disclosing its Scope 3
emissions in 2021, announcing a goal to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 10% by 2030.
