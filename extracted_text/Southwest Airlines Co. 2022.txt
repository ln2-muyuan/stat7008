Safety Operational Philosophy
Southwest Airlines’ Operational Philosophy defines key Operational Philosophy
principles and expectations for Frontline Employees. Most
importantly, and without compromise, we put Safety first.
Employees are expected to follow Company policies and
procedures designed to enable operations at an acceptable
level of risk for Southwest in compliance with regulatory
requirements. Next, and only after operating safely, we
balance being low-cost and reliable, all delivered with world-
class Hospitality. The operational philosophy provides a

Southwest Airlines for success. This operational philosophy
positively impacts our Customers and Employees and helps to
mitigate potential, negative impacts of the operation.
At Southwest, our commitment to Safety is embodied in our
Safety Management System (SMS), which establishes the
framework that enables Southwest to operate safely. The SMS
framework is comprised of four main components: Safety
Policy, Safety Risk Management, Safety Assurance, and Safety
Promotion. These components are seamlessly integrated into
all of our processes, establishing a robust structure for Safety

Components of SMS
The Safety Assurance function of the SMS relies on data
and analytics to continuously measure and analyze the
effectiveness of risk controls and overall Safety performance.
Southwest monitors Safety performance using a variety of
data including Employee reporting, aircraft information,
Safety investigations, fatigue programs, and audits. Audit data
is specifically used to proactively evaluate the effectiveness
of Safety risk controls. We proactively look for things that
can cause injury or damage when we implement a new or
changed policy or procedure. We also monitor Safety risk
controls through assurance systems. Not only do we look at
recent controls implemented, but we are always continuously
monitoring controls that have been in our systems for an
extended period of time. We use our assurance programs to
look at control effectiveness across all operational processes;
when we have indications that are not what we expect, we do
further analysis and have formalized the system assessment
process to document decisions and fixes when the Safety
performance is not acceptable. In 2022, we conducted more
than 100 system assessments. For example, a recent change

Customer Satisfaction
Southwest Airlines’ Operational Philosophy is based on the
belief that the Company prospers when we are safe, low cost,
reliable, and hospitable. Delivering Hospitality means that
Southwest Employees and Customers feel welcomed, cared
for, and appreciated. We have dedicated Teams in place to
provide resources and training opportunities to support our
People in continuing the legacy of legendary Hospitality that
Southwest is known for. A key component of Southwest’s
Vision is to be the world’s most loved airline. We work to
achieve this Vision by:
● Improving Customer Satisfaction by enhancing current
offerings and working to remove friction from the
Customer journey.
● Bolstering Customer loyalty by providing proactive
Customer engagement and convenient assistance.
We measure “most loved” through regular reporting on
key metrics like the Department of Transportation’s (DOT)
Customer Satisfaction results, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and
Trip Net Promoter Score (TNPS). We actively solicit Customer
feedback on their Southwest travel experience through regular
post-trip surveys. Customers share their level of satisfaction
with multiple aspects of their travel experience, including
airport lobby, TSA screening, gate area, boarding process,
inflight experience, connection process, deplaning process,
and baggage claim. We use these insights to understand wins
and pain points for our Customers across all aspects of their
travel journey and all Southwest stations to inform future
actions. In 2022, Southwest announced major Customer
Experience enhancements. We are always looking for
additional opportunities to equip our Employees to serve our
Customers with even more warmth, Hospitality, and Heart,
giving our Customers more reasons than ever to fly Southwest.
For more details on our Customer Experience enhancements,
please see the Transforming the Customer Experience story
for additional information.
The external impact of Legendary Customer Service is
represented in the thought that treating Customers right is
not only good for business, but good for society as well. The
Heart in our logo celebrates the dignity and worth of every
human being. Southwest seeks to raise the bar for Customer
Satisfaction throughout the entire aviation industry—but our
desire to provide top service doesn’t stop there. We aspire
to be the gold standard for Customer Satisfaction for every
Company worldwide. Internally, Southwest relies heavily
on highly engaged Employees to produce the Culture and
Customer Experience that has made Southwest famous.
The Southwest model lends itself to first creating a strong
Employee Experience and Culture, and from that comes an
excellent Customer Experience.

We recalculated our prior years of GHG emissions, including our baseline year of 2019, due to two findings: (1) the
emissions factor we had historically applied for jet fuel consumption was misaligned with other forms of reporting,
such as CORSIA. We therefore updated our emissions factor for jet fuel to align with the ICAO factor for the
aviation industry, at 3.16 kg CO/kg fuel. This new factor was applied to all years going back to 2013; (2) we found

a slight double counting of non-scheduled service jet fuel gallons in our baseline year as well as one other year
(representing <1% of total gallons), which was addressed and updated during this inventory cycle to reflect the
accurate number of gallons consumed. All of these updates to both our baseline year, current year, and prior years
were reviewed by a third party and granted assurance.

of pounds of materials every year, helping keep it out of landfills. In 2022, we donated nearly 126,000 lbs
of used aircraft seat covers.
● At the end of their lifespan when our aircraft are ready for retirement to make room for more efficient aircraft, we have a
strategic process to reuse, repurpose, and recycle. On average, 7,200 lbs of metal per aircraft are recovered. Additionally per
plane, 143 seats are upcycled, approximately 916 square feet of carpet are reused, and 42 miles of wire are recycled.
● Southwest partnered with Owens Group for unclaimed baggage/lost items. Through Owens Group, we find service
opportunities and repurpose and distribute non-retail merchandise to those in need. Such as eyeglasses that are given to
people who received services from Lions Club international Foundation SightFirst program, and broken wheelchairs that are
delivered to prisons where they are repaired and then distributed to children and adults with disabilities.
12.6 Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate
sustainability information into their reporting cycle
● We have annually reported on the progress of our sustainability efforts in our One Report, which includes Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI) Standards used to guide our ESG disclosures since 2009. We linked the One Report to Sustainability
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) standards starting in 2020.
In 2022, Southwest further enhanced our reporting by incorporating aspects of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) framework into our reporting.
● Southwest has voluntarily reported our GHG emissions through CDP for the past 11 years. In our CDP response, we report
on our climate change impacts, risks, and opportunities on our business, and provide information on how we’re integrating
climate change into our business strategy.

SDG 13 – Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
13.3 Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change
mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning
● Our long-term goal is to be net zero by 2050. An important step in that long-term plan is a tangible strategy, and we have set
near term goals to help us work toward net zero by 2050, including goals to:
● Reduce our carbon emissions intensity 25% by 2030 and 50% by 2035 as compared with 2019.3

39 In the course of our qualitative analysis of potential climate impacts, we did not identify significant short-term exposure risks impacting our
operations, except with respect to tropical and winter storms. However, given that these scenarios are subject to a number of assumptions and
projections, we cannot guarantee that this determination will not change or that we will not experience increased short-term risks related to our
operations.

42 Exposure means the likelihood and magnitude of chronic and acute physical climate impacts to Southwest regions. The exposure scores use
multiple sources of publicly available, peer-reviewed climate science data and confidence levels to reflect the potential acute and chronic changes
to the climate. A high impact means a high likelihood of significant changes to the physical climate in the region. This doesn't consider each
Southwest region's ability to change, adapt, and continue to operate, nor does it factor in Southwest’s and a community's adaptive capacity and
resilience measures.
43 Exposure means the likelihood and magnitude of transition activities' impact to Southwest. The exposure scores leverage information provided by
Southwest about the present-day exposure and consider how these risks will change over time according to the International Energy Agency (IEA)
scenarios. The sensitivity scoring is specific to Southwest and was developed through internal Stakeholder interviews, a review of relevant project
materials, as well as disclosures from Southwest’s and peers’ public risk disclosures.

50 The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
("GAAP"). These GAAP financial statements may include (i) unrealized noncash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a
result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii)
other charges and benefits the Company believes are unusual and/or infrequent in nature and thus may make comparisons to its prior or future
performance difficult.
As a result, the Company also provides financial information in this report that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be
considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial
information (also referred to as "excluding special items"), including results that it refers to as "economic," which the Company's management
utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental
information to its GAAP results. The non-GAAP measures provided that relate to the Company’s performance on an economic fuel cost basis
include: net income, non-GAAP.
The Company's economic fuel and oil expense results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel
hedge contracts—all reflected within fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, fuel and oil expense on an economic basis has
historically been utilized by the Company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the Company’s actual net cash
outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts
that are designated as hedges are reflected as a component of Fuel and oil expense, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes
in the period of contract settlement. The Company believes these economic results provide further insight into the impact of the Company's fuel
hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, noncash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded
in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel
derivative contracts within fuel and oil expense. This enables the Company's management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess
the Company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel
expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations,
and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly
comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Further information on (i) the Company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes
of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
The Company’s GAAP results in the applicable periods may include other charges or benefits that are also deemed "special items," that the
Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends. Financial measures
identified as non-GAAP (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. For the periods presented, in addition to the
items discussed above, special items include:
• Proceeds related to the Payroll Support programs, which were used to pay a portion of Employee salaries, wages, and benefits;
• Changes and adjustments to previously accrued amounts related to the Company's extended leave programs;
• Adjustments for prior period losses reclassified from AOCI associated with forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that were terminated
in prior periods related to 12 -8 aircraft leases;
• Noncash impairment charges, primarily associated with adjustments to salvage values for previously retired airframes;
• Unrealized mark-to-market adjustment associated with certain available for sale securities; and
• Losses associated with the partial extinguishment of the Company’s convertible notes and early prepayment of debt.

50 In third quarter 2022, management determined that presentation within its income statement would be enhanced by classification of Loss on
(Continued) extinguishment of debt as a separate line item, rather than its prior presentation where it was included as a component of Other (gains) losses,
net. Such losses are incurred as a result of opportunistic decisions made by the Company to prepay portions of its debt, most of which was taken
on during the pandemic in order to provide liquidity during the prolonged downturn in air travel. Due to the nature of these losses, which are
difficult to accurately predict, and due to the fact that they are not representative of the Company’s day-to-day airline operating performance,
the Company has included such amounts as special items and thus excluded them from certain of its non-GAAP measures in the accompanying
reconciliation.
Because management believes special items can distort the trends associated with the Company’s ongoing performance as an airline, the
Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact
of special items, in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis
for evaluating operating results in future periods. The following measure is often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the Company’s
management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to industry trends: net income, non-GAAP.
Information regarding special items and reconciliation of reported amounts to amounts excluding special items are included in the accompanying
reconciliation table in the Performance section.

64 U.S. Department of Transportation. (2023, March “updated”). Air Travel Consumer Report (ATCR): A Product of the Office of Aviation Enforcement
and Proceedings, Aviation Consumer Protection Division. Washington, D.C. The Department of Transportation (DOT) ranks all U.S. carriers based
on the lowest ratio of complaints per 100,000 passengers enplaned, as published in the DOT Air Travel Consumer Report (ATCR). As a result of
significant operational disruptions experienced at the end of December, Southwest finished sixth in Customer Satisfaction among U.S. Marketing
Carriers based on a cumulative 6.75 ratio of DOT complaints per 100,000 enplaned passengers for 2022. A Marketing Carrier is an airline that
advertises under a common brand name, sells reservations, manages frequent flyer programs, and is ultimately responsible for the airline’s
consumer policies. Operating Carriers only handle the flight operations, passenger check-in/boarding, and baggage handling for the respective
Marketing Carriers they serve—Operating Carriers are not responsible for DOT complaints related to policies, procedures, and advertising
associated with the Marketing Carrier’s brand. https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2023-04/February%202023%20ATCR_Revised.pdf
