About this report
Key’s annual Environmental, Social, and Governance
(ESG) Report describes performance and activities related
to the sustainability and societal impact of our business
and investments.
It is a companion piece to our Annual Report to
shareholders, providing all stakeholders with an update on
the company’s priorities and progress as both a
responsible bank and citizen. The data reported in the
2022 ESG Report covers the period between January 1
and December 31, 2022. In instances where programs or
initiatives were enhanced or introduced in the first quarter
of 2023, the narrative description reflects those changes.

responsibility (CR) progress of KeyCorp, including
KeyCorp’s subsidiary bank, KeyBank National Association.

“us,” and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity

governance efforts by using the Global Reporting Initiative

Supporting Texas’ Grid
A major highlight of the past year was KBCM’s role in a significant finance deal for a utility-scale stand-alone battery storage
project. In April, Key provided Jupiter Power, based in Austin, Texas, $174.6 million in financing for six stand-alone battery
energy storage projects. The 655 megawatt-hours of storage capacity will support the Texas grid’s reliability as it shifts to
renewable energy sources.
The Jupiter Power financing was one of the first deals following the announcement of our five-year, $38 billion sustainable
financing commitment. The loan also exemplifies our intent to build a sustainable business model that manages risk,
capitalizes on opportunities, and supports the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Achieving operational sustainability
Key is focused on enhancing our operational sustainability. Reducing the environmental impact associated with our real estate
footprint is an ongoing effort and maintaining and operating efficient workspaces remains a priority.
Key’s Corporate Real Estate Solutions team leads many of our operational sustainability activities, making significant facility
and operational improvements by applying green building principles and investing in energy management systems and
equipment upgrades across our real estate portfolio. We continue to see the positive effects of Key’s multiyear effort to
profitably reduce our GHG footprint. By tracking energy consumption and emissions at the site level, we can best allocate
resources for capital improvements and identify defective equipment where repairs may be needed.
In April 2022, we amplified our ambitions and committed to achieving carbon neutrality from our scope 1 direct and scope 2
indirect emissions by 2030. While we strive for carbon neutrality, we recognize that reducing absolute emissions is critical for
the planet; for this reason, we continue to monitor progress toward our previously announced scope 1 and 2 emission
reduction goals. Our ambition is to source 20% of our energy from renewable sources by 2030 and 60% by 2050 and reduce
our scope 1 and 2 emissions 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Together, these goals will make sure that we not only achieve
carbon neutrality, but also continue to reduce our overall emissions.

Through investments in energy efficiency, strategic site consolidations, and the overall greening of the grid, we have reduced
GHG emissions by 39% and energy consumption by 28% since 2016. This progress puts us ahead of our projected pace for
GHG emission reductions, having already achieved 97% of our 2030 goal and 48% of our 2050 goal.
In addition to our commitments to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce our overall emissions, we joined the Partnership for
Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). PCAF is a global collaboration among financial institutions focused on enabling
consistent assessments and disclosures of GHG emissions financed by loans and investments. In 2022, we completed an
initial assessment of our scope 3, category 15 financed emissions.
We are also partnering with a leading energy advisor to develop a strategy to achieve our decarbonization goals. Key
completed an in-depth analysis of our real estate portfolio, assessed energy usage and available decarbonization levers, and
is now developing optimization scenarios to reduce its emissions.

Paper reduction
A substantial amount of paper consumption is generated from standard daily activities, such as required disclosures, monthly
statements, and signature pages. Our paper reduction strategy, which launched in late 2020, continues to reduce the use of
paper across the enterprise. In 2022, Key reduced its printing by 8 million pages, reducing our impact on natural resources
(shown below) and saving nearly $1 million in costs.
Paper reduction can primarily be attributed to several initiatives that encourage sustainable printing and mailing practices. For
example, by redesigning certain demand deposit account statements and consumer lending statements, the average
statement length decreased by one page; as a result, we saved approximately 4.3 million sheets of paper. Additionally, by
encouraging our clients to select paperless options, we reduced the number of mailed statements by 1.2 million in 2022, or
roughly 3.7 million sheets of paper.
As Key and more of our clients embrace a digital-first strategy, we expect the downstream impact on paper reduction to grow.

into supply chain relationships.
In 2022, Key leveraged an updated request-for-proposal
questionnaire that more intentionally considered ESG,
along with diversity, equity, and inclusion topics (DE&I),
during the third-party evaluation and selection process.
Key’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which has been in place
since 2016, was updated to reflect our current
expectations on environmental practices, workplace health
and safety, ethics, and DE&I. We put greater emphasis on
demonstrating a commitment to responsible climate
stewardship, including bringing forward ideas for reducing
the environmental impact of the products and services
provided to Key. We also encourage third parties to
assess environmental impacts and sustainability within
their supply chains, including tracking and reporting
metrics such as GHG, carbon footprint, and waste
reduction. To learn more about Key’s Supplier Code of
Conduct, visit the Suppliers Standards for Doing Business
page on key.com.
Suppliers are encouraged to hold us accountable for our
actions as well. The Supplier Code of Conduct provides
clear guidance for reporting any suspected or known
violation of Key’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
through an anonymous ethics helpline.

Financial inclusion
Making banking more inclusive to everyone is a critical aspect of how Key helps our clients and communities thrive – from the
products and services we offer to the investments we make in our communities.
Our focus on inclusivity and economic, racial, and environmental equity guides Key’s social responsibility commitments.
Through lending, investing, grants, and volunteerism, we participate in the growth, revitalization, and sustainability of the
communities we proudly serve.
Our commitment to inclusive communities
Key’s commitment to inclusive communities is vast, encompassing a broad range of programs, initiatives, and collaborations.
Every part of our business supports building our legacy as a responsible corporate citizen and engaged community member.
Our community investments bring access to capital for neighborhoods and neighbors who often face barriers to financial
support. Our investments support affordable housing and community development projects nationwide; small business and
home lending in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities; and philanthropic efforts targeted toward education, workforce
development, and building safe, vital neighborhoods. In 2022, Key has invested more than $6 billion in the communities we
serve, bringing our total lending and investments to nearly $33 billion since 2017.

Homeownership is essential to building healthy and

Indiana Black Expo
Key has enjoyed a strong relationship with Indiana Black
Expo (IBE) for many years.
In February 2022, Key invested $300,000 to assist with
IBE’s new Black Business Training Institute, a 10-week
business management program providing training on
practical skills that owners can immediately apply to their
business. The funds helped IBE offer the program free-of-
charge to a larger number of participants in response to
high demand. Two cohorts of 120 business owners went
through the program in spring 2022. The program also
awarded $5,000 to a business owner in each cohort who

provide LMI wage earners with free tax preparation
services and assistance in determining their eligibility for
the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The event known
as Super Refund Saturday is a cost-effective way for tax
filers to navigate the potentially confusing tax preparation
process and ensure they are getting their full return.
In 2022, volunteers from Key helped individuals and
families at events in Cleveland, Ohio, and Seattle,
Washington, prepare over 800 tax returns claiming more
than $300K in EITCs. In addition, Key made philanthropic
contributions to nonprofits in more than 10 markets to
support similar tax preparation events.

Pay equity
Building a fair pay structure
Key is committed to pay equity across our entire workforce. As of February 2023 at Key, women earn on average more than
99% of what their male teammates earn, and people of color earn on average more than 99% of what their white teammates
earn, accounting for an employee’s job. Our analysis is based on total compensation (base salary and all discretionary
incentives), covering all teammates throughout our organization eligible for discretionary incentive, other than our Executive
Leadership Team whose pay is set by our Board of Directors.
Moving forward, we will report our pay parity measures annually and will continue to evolve our disclosure as the landscape
develops.
How we support pay equity
Key’s commitment to pay equity is foundational to our culture, which is supported through our policies and practices in the
following ways:
• We maintain a formal compensation structure to establish pay based on objective factors, including external market
survey data, required education, and experience. We regularly review this structure relative to market trends and
internal equity.
• We have a pay-for-performance philosophy in which pay decisions are based on the assessment of individual
performance, business unit performance, and the performance of Key. These decisions also consider performance
against risk expectations and whether a teammate has exhibited behaviors consistent with our values.
• As part of our year-end compensation process, we complete a pay practice review of our entire workforce by race/
ethnicity and gender to make sure pay and performance are aligned. If disparities are found, adjustments are made
as warranted.
• In compliance with various state and local laws and as part of Key’s long-standing commitment to equal employment
opportunity, we do not seek current base compensation information from applicants, regardless of location, or
consider an applicant’s compensation history when formulating an offer. Key also provides salary range information
when requested by applicants, supporting greater pay transparency during the hiring process, and further enhancing
practices that support pay equity and fairness.
• We continually assess and enhance our practices and engage third-party partners to consult on our pay equity
analysis and practices as needed. The framework used to analyze pay discrepancies has been in place for more than
10 years, but it has evolved over time to become even more comprehensive. As a result, we believe our practices are
an effective control to monitor and address pay inequities.

and opportunities are integrated into Key’s long-term
business strategy; that the company is measuring and
monitoring progress against the ESG commitments set as
part of the strategy; and that ESG risks are well managed.
ESG and sustainability policies and practices are
monitored closely by the Board’s Nominating and

Risk and oversight
KeyCorp risk governance
Accountability, integrity, leadership, respect, and teamwork are core values at Key, driving our daily actions and decisions. We
hold ourselves to high standards of corporate governance and ethical business practices. Effective governance is at the core
of our company and its ability to manage all types of risks and opportunities for the benefit of our shareholders and other
stakeholders.
Risk management responsibility
The table below depicts our risk management hierarchy.
Our Board of Directors approves our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Policy and sets the overall level of risk Key is willing
to accept and manage in pursuit of our strategic objectives. The ERM Policy encompasses our risk philosophy, policy
framework, and governance structure for the management of risks across the company. The included Risk Appetite Statement
describes the industries Key will not do business with, including for socially responsible purposes. The Policy also provides a
framework for effective governance and regular review and challenge across our three lines of defense, as described in the
Managing risk at Key section of this report.

Managing risk at Key
Key remains disciplined in managing our risk and capital. We have maintained our moderate risk profile, including strong
underwriting standards, and we have taken steps to position the company to perform through any business cycle.
To further align with the moderate risk appetite, Key employs “three lines of defense” for risk governance.
1st Line of Defense: 2nd Line of Defense: 3rd Line of Defense:

The three lines are balanced in importance and stature, and they must all operate effectively across the enterprise to sustain
strong risk management. Risk appetite is considered as strategic alternatives are evaluated, performance objectives are
established, and mechanisms are strengthened to manage risks.
Key maintains a strong risk culture through proactive risk management activities integrated into business processes as well as
employee risk awareness training.

Note Regarding Materiality and Forward-Looking Statements
Our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and climate-related disclosures are voluntary disclosures. Our approach to these voluntary disclosures often considers disclosure recommendations and
broader definitions of materiality promulgated by certain external frameworks and reporting guidelines that differ from the definition of materiality used for purposes of complying with the disclosure rules
and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and applicable stock exchange listing standards. Accordingly, we may present voluntary ESG and climate-related
information from a different perspective than in our SEC reports, and any use of the term “material” in the context of such information may be distinct from such term as defined for SEC reporting
purposes. Any inclusion of ESG and climate-related information in this report is not an indication that the subject or information is material to Key for SEC reporting purposes.
The goals and projects described in our ESG and climate-related disclosures involve, and are based on, targets, commitments, estimates, assumptions, standards, methodologies, and currently available
data, which continue to evolve and develop. As such, we cannot guarantee or promise that these goals and projects will be met or achieved as described. Additionally, our ESG and climate-related
information is as of the date referenced, subject to change without notice, and may be regarded as indicative and for illustrative purposes only. This information may vary based on applicable laws, rules
and regulations and may also include the use of non-financial metrics and/or other information that are subject to significant measurement uncertainties, which may include the methodology, collection
and verification of data, various estimates and assumptions, and/or underlying data that is obtained from third parties, some of which cannot be independently verified.
This report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our future performance
and business and ESG and climate-related targets, goals, metrics, aspirations, strategies, and plans, which may develop and evolve over time. Forward-looking statements usually can be identified by
words such as “goal,” “objective,” “target,” “plan,” “expect,” “assume,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “project,” “believe,” “estimate,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or other words of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements reflect Key’s current expectations, plans, projections, or forecasts of future events, circumstances, results, or aspirations, are not guarantees of future results or performance,
and are subject to risks, uncertainties, changes in circumstances and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond our control. Given the inherent uncertainty of the estimates,
assumptions, and timelines contained in this report, we may not be able to anticipate whether or the degree to which we will be able to meet or implement our targets, goals, strategies, or plans in
advance. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. If underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could vary
materially from these expectations, plans, projections, or forecasts.
Factors that could cause Key’s actual results or outcomes to differ from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements include, among others, global socio-demographic and
economic trends, legislative or regulatory changes, public policies, energy prices, technological innovations, our ability to gather and verify data regarding environmental impacts, our ability to successfully
implement various initiatives throughout the company under expected time frames, engagement with clients, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders, climate-related conditions
and weather events, the compliance of various third parties with our policies and procedures and legal requirements, and other unforeseen events or conditions including those factors identified in
KeyCorp’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as in KeyCorp’s subsequent SEC filings, which have been filed with the SEC and are available on Key’s website key.com/ir and on the
SEC’s website www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made or will be, and Key does not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect
new information or future events. Additionally, this report may contain statements based on hypothetical scenarios and assumptions, which may not occur or differ significantly from actual events. These
statements should not necessarily be considered as being indicative of current or actual risk or forecasts of expected risk.
