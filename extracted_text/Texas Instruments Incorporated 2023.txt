(quantities in kilograms) and we comply with this requirement. Recently, the WSC has aligned on all regions moving to the 2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidance, which includes FHTFs. TI is reviewing the
timing of a transition to the 2019 IPCC guidance and will consider the inclusion of FHTF emissions upon adoption. TI estimates the emissions from FHTFs to be approximately 5% of 2023 scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions.

5 TI has not included emissions from fluorinated heat transfer fluids (FHTFs) in its Corporate Citizenship Report because of varying calculation methodologies and guidance. Under current World Semiconductor Council (WSC) reporting guidance, the association that tracks semiconductor emissions,
there is no requirement to track and report FHTFs. Recently introduced U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for disclosure to the EPA included FHTFs (quantities in kilograms) and we comply with this requirement. Recently, the WSC has aligned on all regions moving to the 2019
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidance, which includes FHTFs. TI is reviewing the timing of a transition to the 2019 IPCC guidance and will consider the inclusion of FHTF emissions upon adoption. TI estimates the emissions from FHTFs to be approximately 5% of the total
2023 scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions.
6 T I is focused on the total reductions of scope 1 and scope 2 GHGs and the company’s disclosure of the baseline reflects that approach. TI’s 2015 GHG emissions baseline was adjusted in the 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report to reflect structural changes to its operations, including the divestiture of a wafer
fabrication plant in Scotland and the acquisition of a 300mm wafer fabrication plant in Utah. The 2015 baseline has been adjusted from 2,471,357 to 2,832,709 MTCO2e in line with the guidance provided by the WBCSD/WRI’s “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.”
7 ERM Certification and Verification Services (CVS) provided limited assurance of TI’s GHG emissions for 2022 and 2023. See Assurance Statement.
8 TI does not include nitrous oxide (N2O) in its air emissions calculations because the company accounts for N2O in its GHG emissions data. The 2023 data was not available at the time of publication; TI will report emissions to state air quality regulators in Maine, Utah and Texas.

24 In 2021, TI disclosed new data based on updated Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 306: Waste 2020 standards, allowing the reporting of hazardous waste separately from nonhazardous industrial waste. This methodology significantly reduced the amounts reported for hazardous waste.
25 Increases in hazardous waste to disposal were a result of transportation vendor and purchasing party issues.
26 Remodeling activities at some TI sites caused an increase in nonhazardous waste directed to disposal, as well as transportation vendor and purchasing party issues.
27 2021 and earlier reporting included an incorrect classification of waste as hazardous when it was nonhazardous. The 2022 data reflects the corrected shift to the nonhazardous category.
28 The waste vendor in Lehi, Utah, diverted waste to incineration; TI’s site in Portland, Maine, reclassified waste from nonhazardous recovery.

GRI Standard Indicator Page Additional response
N/A 3-3 Management of material topics 8, 22 Note: The following applies to TI’s overall environmental, safety and health (ESH) management. See Environmental Sustainability and
Health and Safety for more information.
Management system
Our ESH management system facilitates the planning, execution, evaluation and management oversight of activities and strategies. It
meets certification requirements set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (environmental management
system criteria) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management system criteria). Our management system also contains
programs, policies, controls, processes and measurement tools based on industry best practices and international standards. It helps us
mitigate risks, improve our performance, fulfill compliance obligations, and achieve our objectives.
Programs include extensive chemical and material screening, material sourcing, waste profiling, emissions management, and responsible
recycling and disposal. We require 100% of our employees and supplemental contractors at all manufacturing and assembly and test
sites to adhere to management system requirements. Other personnel not managed by TI are responsible for following their companies’
ESH management procedures and applicable regulatory requirements.
To ensure that our management system is effective, our Worldwide ESH Compliance Support team and independent third parties perform
audits at each facility every three years; in interim years, the facilities perform self-assessments. They examine compliance with legal and
TI standards and training effectiveness. Additionally, we:
• Survey employees and external stakeholders.
• Conduct legally required inspections and monitor incident rates.
• Benchmark against the RBA’s self-assessment disclosure, its code of conduct, and against peers and members of the Semiconductor
Industry Association.
• Assess select sites using a third-party auditor under the RBA’s Validated Audit Program.
We communicate gaps and best practices to other sites and have not had to make significant adjustments to our corporate-level ESH
management system because of audit findings. Each manufacturing site also reports performance using a scorecard that measures
energy use, water efficiency and landfill diversion. We share scorecards internally to build awareness of best practices and hold ourselves
accountable for improvement.
Additionally, we provide our ESH team with extensive training and tools to implement appropriate industry best practices and comply with
regulatory requirements.
Policies
We require employees and supplemental contractors at all manufacturing and assembly and test sites to adhere to our ESH Policy and
Principles. It is available in multiple languages: traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Spanish, German and Korean.
Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct also contains environmental management expectations.
Engagement
We evaluate a proposed project’s potential positive and negative impacts on a community by conducting environmental
impact assessments.
Grievance channels
All employees and supplemental contractors have “stop work” authority to remove themselves from work situations that they believe
could cause injury, illness or environmental harm. They can also anonymously contact their supervisor, site ESH staff or the TI Ethics
Office. Customers can contact TI.com/support or email all other ESH-related inquiries to citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com.

Water and effluents management. TI’s ESH water-management standard outlines requirements of wastewater programs, sewage treatment programs,
stormwater pollution prevention and water reduction activities at each site. Additionally, we:
• Visually inspect our on-site wastewater treatment plants regularly to ensure that they operate properly and do not leak.
• Periodically clean the plants and inspect the treatment basins for integrity.
• Hire trained or certified operators as required.
We calculate consumption data from water utility bills at sites that we financially control and that are larger than 50,000 square feet.
Each year, we voluntarily report our water footprint to the CDP and in this report.
Water sources
Our water sources include surface water from local municipal supplies and groundwater. Our water footprint comprises three types
of water:
• Nonmanufacturing – used in restrooms, irrigation, drinking fountains and cafeterias.
• Manufacturing – used to rinse wafers after chemical processing or for other fabrication processes.
• Manufacturing support – used in exhaust abatement and cooling systems.

Water and effluents resource limits in our permits, following TI standards, and ensuring that sites follow good housekeeping practices while actively collaborating to
continuously improve and minimize exposure to water pathways.
See Water and TI’s most recent CDP response for how TI interacts with water and collaborates with stakeholders regarding this
shared resource.
TI’s main manufacturing and assembly and test facilities set annual water conservation goals based on projects they identified as part
of the company’s ongoing water reduction strategy. Sites develop and complete water conservation projects based on various factors,
including process system reliability, economic feasibility and sustainability targets. Public policy and water stress also factor into these
decisions, influencing the availability and cost of water, which drive water reduction and reclaim efforts to ensure system reliability and
business continuity.

related impacts quality standards for effluents, which all TI sites manage to permissible limits. Some regulators incorporate sector-specific standards to set
their requirements.
Our internal water management standard includes guidelines that ensure compliance with wastewater, stormwater and sewage discharge
permits, along with other requirements. Sites monitor water quality and have procedures to manage spills or other abnormalities. We report
wastewater discharges and the portion of total water discharged through regulated wastewater treatment points to local, state, federal and
international regulatory agencies.
303-3 Water withdrawal 44 See Performance Data in the appendix for water withdrawal data. Municipal sources and groundwater supply our water. We calculate
withdrawal from sites TI fully controls larger than 50,000 square feet.
303-4 Water discharge 43 Federal, state or local regulators create wastewater permits that define and determine priority substances that must meet discharge limits.
We comply with these limits by treating water in on-site treatment plants, separating concentrated metals and solvents from waste streams,
and taking other actions. See Performance Data in the appendix for water discharge data.
303-5 Water consumption 12, 43 See Water and Performance Data in the appendix for water consumption and storage data. We calculate consumption data from total water

Emissions about how we manage GHGs. We conduct routine monitoring and audits to comply with air quality and GHG emission regulations and
reporting requirements that vary by country, state and municipality. We must report U.S. GHG emissions to the U.S. EPA to comply with
mandatory reporting requirements.
The EPA requires that the semiconductor industry (among other industries) measure and report annual fluorinated GHG emissions (such
as sulfur hexafluoride [SF], perfluorocarbons [PFCs] and hydrochlorofluorocarbons), as well as GHG emissions from combustion sources.

We also voluntarily report our GHG emissions data to the World Semiconductor Council (as part of the U.S. industry report), the CDP and
our annual Corporate Citizenship Report.
TI reports U.S. air emissions data to federal and state regulators. We also report chemical releases and pollution prevention activities to
the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory.
Boundaries
Our organizational boundary includes TI manufacturing sites, larger nonmanufacturing sites, and support facilities subject to contracts
considered embedded leases by TI for financial accounting purposes. Our operational boundary includes scope 1 and 2 emissions from
these sites and facilities, as applicable.
For more information on TI’s approach to GHG emissions reporting, see the TI Basis of Reporting statement.
305-1 Direct (scope 1) GHG emissions 41 See Performance Data in the appendix for scope 1 data. The gases included in data calculations include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), PFCs, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
We calculate scope 1 GHG emissions using relevant guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the EPA’s
Mandatory Reporting Rule and published emission factors. Our methodology includes accepted quantification methods, emission factors
and global warming potential. For more information, see TI’s most recent CDP response.
305-2 Indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions 41 See Performance Data in the appendix for scope 2 market- and location-based data and our response to 305-1. The gases included in
our market- and location-based data calculations include CO2, CH4 and N2O. In 2023, we made no significant emissions changes that
triggered base-year emissions recalculations.
The EPA’s GHG Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Requirements (MRR) Final Rule is our source of emissions factors and global
warming potential rates. Scope 2 location-based electricity emission factors are from the U.S. EPA eGRID for U.S. sites and the
International Energy Agency for all international sites. Scope 2 market-based factors are the Green E residual mix for U.S. locations and
the Association of Issuing Bodies Residual mix for our Freising, Germany, location. All calculations for scope 2 emissions follow either
U.S. EPA MMR or IPCC Tier 2 requirements. See TI’s most recent CDP response for more information.
305-3 Other indirect (scope 3) GHG emissions 10 See Greenhouse Gas Emissions and TI’s most recent CDP response for scope 3 GHG emissions information.
305-4 GHG emissions intensity – TI’s normalized GHG market-based emissions intensity ratio in 2023 was 0.32. The ratio equals the emissions intensity in 2023 divided
by the emissions intensity in 2005. We calculate the intensity using the sum of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions as the numerator and the
number of chips produced within TI as the denominator.
305-5 Reduction of GHG emissions 10, 41 TI’s scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions were down 22% from 2015 to 2023. See Performance Data in the appendix and TI’s most recent

We performed a limited assurance engagement, in accordance with the International
Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance Engagements
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.
Assurance
standard and level The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and
of assurance timing from and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and
consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is
substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a
reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
Texas Instruments is responsible for preparing the Report and for the collection and
presentation of the information within it, and for the designing, implementing, and
maintaining of internal controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of the
Respective Report.
responsibilities
ERM CVS’ responsibility is to provide a conclusion to Texas Instruments on the agreed
scope based on our engagement terms with Texas Instruments, the assurance
activities performed and exercising our professional judgement.
Our conclusion
Based on our activities, as described below, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the 2023 data
and information for the disclosures listed under ‘Scope’ above are not fairly presented in the Report, in all
material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.
Emphasis of matter
Without affecting our conclusion, we draw attention to the explanatory notes provided by Texas Instruments
relating to the data on page 10 of the Report and on page 4 in the Appendices section of the Report, in
particular the limitations relating to the exclusion of Fluorinated Heat Transfer Fluids from Scope 1 GHG
emissions reported.
Our assurance activities
Considering the level of assurance and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the Report a
multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed a range of procedures that
included, but was not restricted to, the following:
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria for the Report;
• Interviews with relevant staff to understand and evaluate the management systems and processes
(including internal review and control processes) used for collecting and reporting the selected
disclosures;
• A review at corporate level of a sample of qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting the reported
information;
• An analytical review of the year-end data submitted by all locations included in the consolidated 2023
group data for the selected disclosures which included testing the completeness and mathematical
accuracy of conversions and calculations, and consolidation in line with the stated reporting boundary;
• In-person site visit to Texas Instruments’ North Dallas Campus (USA) and Chengdu (China) facilities to
review source data and local reporting systems and controls;
• Evaluating the conversion and emission factors and assumptions used;
• Reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the Report to ensure
consistency with our findings.
The limitations of our engagement
The reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for
determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information. It is important to understand our assurance
conclusions in this context.
Our independence, integrity and quality control
ERM CVS is an independent certification and verification body accredited by UKAS to ISO 17021:2015.
Accordingly, we maintain a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and
regulatory requirements. Our quality management system is at least as demanding as the relevant sections of
ISQM-1 and ISQM-2 (2022).
ERM CVS applies a Code of Conduct and related policies to ensure that its employees maintain integrity,
objectivity, professional competence and high ethical standards in their work. Our processes are designed and
implemented to ensure that the work we undertake is objective, impartial and free from bias and conflict of
interest. Our certified management system covers independence and ethical requirements that are at least as
demanding as the relevant sections of the IESBA Code relating to assurance engagements.
ERM CVS has extensive experience in conducting assurance on environmental, social, ethical and health and
safety information, systems and processes, and provides no consultancy related services to Texas Instruments
in any respect.
Other Matters - observations
We have provided Texas Instruments with a separate management report. Without affecting the conclusions
presented above, we have the following observations:
• During the 2023 assurance engagement, Texas Instruments provided insights on the ongoing
assessment of available methodologies, standards and impacts of incorporating Fluorinated Heat
Transfer Fluids (FHTFs) into its GHG inventory to align with IPCC 2019 and industry peers. We highly
encourage completion of these efforts in 2024.
