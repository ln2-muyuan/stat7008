EXPLANATIONS
1. The floor area used to calculate the Scopes 1 & 2 emissions intensities and the total portfolio energy intensity is weighted for the time each property was operational
during that reporting year. For example, if an asset was purchased in March 2021, we would estimate its energy consumption for the days owned between March 2021
and 12/31/2021, not the whole year. By applying the same coefficient (days owned in year / days in year) to the floor area, we are adjusting for properties that were
acquired or disposed throughout the year.
2. The floor area used to calculate the Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location- and market-based) emissions intensities is the sum of gross floor area for buildings that are within
Welltower's control boundary, not under construction, and owned in that reporting year. This means properties within Welltower's financial control boundary and
considered stable or in lease-/fill-up for the reporting year are included.
3. The floor area used for Scope 3 emissions intensity calculations, as well as for any intensity and data coverage for "non-control" properties, is the sum of the gross floor
area for buildings that are not in Welltower's control boundary, not under construction, and owned in that reporting year. This means properties outside of Welltower's
financial control boundary and considered stable or in lease-fill-up are included.

LRQA’s Approach
LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure. The following tasks
were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:
• interviewing relevant employees of the organization responsible for managing GHG emissions and
Sustainability data and records;
• assessing Welltower’s data management systems to confirm they are designed to prevent significant errors,
omissions or mis-statements in the Report. We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling
procedures, instructions and systems, including those for internal quality control; and
• verifying historical GHG emissions and Sustainability data and records at an aggregated level for CY 2021.
