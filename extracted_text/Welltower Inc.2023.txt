ESG POLICY
Welltower drafted an ESG Policy in 2023 to codify our commitment
to sustainability.
The policy was approved by the Board of Directors and officially adopted in early spring
of 2024. It covers each ESG category we focus on and can be found on Welltower’s
website. At a high level, this policy covers:
• ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY: Our goal is prudent environmental stewardship
with a focus on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, water
usage, and waste production; mitigating climate change risks; and implementing energy
efficiency, water efficiency, and renewable energy technologies across our portfolio.
• SOCIAL WELL-BEING: Welltower aims to provide an inclusive, healthy, and safe
environment for employees; to embrace diverse thinking in the workplace; and to
offer opportunities for our employees to grow professionally. Welltower believes in
promoting physical, mental, social, and financial well-being – the happier, healthier, and
more comfortable our employees are, the better we can serve our stakeholders and
communities.
• ETHICS, TRANSPARENCY, AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE: We believe a dedicated
and demonstrated commitment to ethical behavior is the right thing to do, good
business, and the surest way for us to remain a business leader, an employer of choice,
and a good corporate citizen.

COMPENSATION
ESG has been a focal point for Welltower for many years.
Beginning in 2021, the annual incentive program introduced
goals across aspects of ESG. Since 2022, the Named
Executive Officers (NEOs) have been evaluated against an
ESG scorecard balancing focus on the “E,” the “S,” and the
“G.” The Compensation Committee established these goals
to continue our progress toward protecting the environment,
attracting and retaining talent, being a good corporate citizen
in the communities in which we operate, and providing a
firm foundation of corporate governance to help operate our
business with the highest level of integrity both internally
and externally. Achievement of these performance objectives
directly impacts annual incentives for Welltower’s executives
and helps determine the larger short-term incentive pool used
to reward all employees based on individual performance.

CONDENSED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT PLAN
All properties owned by Welltower throughout the entirety (or a portion) of calendar year 2023 are included in the entity’s reporting boundaries and portfolio composition for this reporting year. Loans (0% ownership), properties under construction and land are excluded from the asset list and are outside
of the reporting boundaries for Welltower. Welltower defines its control boundary using the financial control approach. Under this approach, medical office buildings directly managed by Welltower and seniors housing operating properties in Welltower’s portfolio are included within the control boundary
(Scope 1 and 2), with triple-net properties considered outside of the financial boundary and included in Scope 3 Category 13: Downstream Leased Assets. The inventory management plan (IMP) describes the data sources and methodology used to prepare Welltower’s 2023 greenhouse gas (GHG)
inventory. Both the IMP and accompanying GHG inventory are created in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) guidance and best practices for calculating emissions associated with Direct
Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources and Indirect Emissions from Purchased Electricity.
1. Utility data tracked in ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager®, along with the year-end property list, is the data source for all portfolio emissions calculations in the GHG inventory.
2. Electricity and natural gas utility data for a property is assigned to energy use intensity (EUI) sample groups if (1) operational days for the property are 365 in the calendar year and (2) there are 5 or less days difference between days of reported consumption and operational days.
3. Sample groups are created for each property type (electricity) or emissions region (natural gas) and used to estimate energy consumption at properties without available data. Emissions regions are assigned by country (US – eGRID region, CA – province, UK – country). Property types are based on
Welltower’s property list.
4. Emissions are calculated for each energy commodity in units of metric tons of CO equivalent. The IPCC SAR global warming potentials are used to calculate the CO equivalent.
2 2
5. District hot water emissions calculations assume that district hot water is generated using a natural gas fuel source and that there is a 20% loss of energy.
6. Employee Commuting: The home and work address report is used to calculate emissions associated with employee commuting. Miles traveled per employee are calculated using the following assumptions: i.) Employees commute round trip, 48 weeks per year, 5 days per week. ii.) NYC-, Toronto-, and
London-based employees commute via public transit rail. iii.) Emissions from remote work are calculated for employees designated as permanently remote and those living greater than 70 miles from an office based on the estimated usage of 1 laptop, 1 monitor, and 3 lightbulbs for each 8-hour workday,
5 days per week, 48 weeks per year. b.) Average fuel economy for passenger vehicles was obtained from the USDOT to calculate gallons of fuel used in commuting.
7. Business Travel: 1) Commercial air travel: Reports from commercial flight vendors are used to calculate the number of miles flown in the reporting year. Flights are categorized as short-, medium-, and long-haul based on the following criteria: flights < 300 air miles are short-haul, flights between 300
and 2,300 air miles are medium-haul, and flights above 2,300 air miles are long-haul. UK DEFRA emission factors for each flight category are used to calculate emissions from commercial business travel in units of metric tons of CO equivalent. 2) Private air travel: Emissions from Welltower’s private flight
2
travel are calculated based on fuel consumption estimated using vendor reports on flight time and the average fuel burn for the associated aircraft type. US EPA emission factors for jet fuel are used to calculate emissions from private flight travel in units of metric tons of CO equivalent.

8. Waste: If waste data is reported in volume, rather than weight, then EPA waste volume to weight conversion factors are applied. The year-over-year fluctuations in waste data are largely due to changes in data coverage as no waste data is estimated. Diverted waste includes recycled and composted waste.

LRQA Independent Assurance Statement
Relating to Welltower Inc.’s GHG Emissions and Sustainability Data for the
Calendar Year 2023
This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Welltower Inc. in accordance with our contract.
Terms of Engagement
LRQA was commissioned by Welltower Inc. (Welltower) to provide independent assurance of its greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions inventory and ESG Data (“the Report”) for the calendar year (CY) 2023 against the assurance criteria
below to a limited level of assurance and materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier. The assurance was
performed using LRQA’s verification procedure and ISO 14064 - Part 3 for greenhouse gas emissions. LRQA’s
verification procedure is based on current best practise and is in accordance with ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410.
Our assurance engagement covered Welltower’s operations and activities for their properties in the United States,
Canada and the United Kingdom and specifically the following requirements:
• Verifying conformance with:
• Welltower’s reporting methodologies for the selected datasets; and
• World Resources Institute / World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas
Protocol: A corporate accounting and reporting standard, revised edition (otherwise referred to as the
WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol) for the GHG data1.
• Reviewing whether the Report has taken into account of:
▪ WRI GHG Protocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard.
• Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information for only the selected indicators listed below:
• Direct (Scope 1), Energy Indirect (Scope 2) and Other Indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions;
▪ Scope 3 GHG emissions verified by LRQA were limited to Business travel, Employee commuting,
Waste generated in operations and Downstream leased assets.
• Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions intensity;
• Energy use intensity data;
• Water consumption data;
• Measured waste & recycling data;
• Workforce diversity and remuneration data; and
• Safety metrics.
The GHG emissions data was reported using the Financial Control consolidation approach and covered properties
only for the period under Welltower ownership during the reporting year. Investments categorized as fixed assets
under the GHG Protocol, including land, loans and development projects, were excluded from the reporting
boundary. Direct fugitive GHG emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning equipment were excluded on the
basis of their de minimis contribution to the GHG emissions inventory.
LRQA’s responsibility is only to Welltower. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the
end footnote. Welltower’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and
information within the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the Report
is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of Welltower.

LRQA’s Opinion
Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that Welltower has not,
in all material respects:
• Met the requirements of the criteria listed above; and
• Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and information as summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3 below.
The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance2 and at the materiality of the professional
judgement of the verifier.
Table 1. Summary of Welltower’s GHG Emissions for CY 2023:
Scope of GHG emissions Tonnes CO2e
Scope 1 Total 154,852
• Natural Gas 151,773
• Propane 1,325
• Fuel Oil No. 2 1,754
Scope 2 Location-Based1 435,632
Scope 2 Market-Based1 420,986
Scope 3 Category 5 - Waste generated in operations2 34,078
Scope 3 Category 6 - Business travel3 2,234
Scope 3 Category 7 - Employee commuting 1,131
Scope 3 Category 13 - Downstream leased assets
• Electricity Location-Based 165,018
• Natural Gas 63,450
• Propane 869
• Fuel Oil No. 2 0
• Kerosene 83
Note 1: Scope 2, Location-based and Market-based are defined in the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, 2015.
Note 2: Category 5 represents emissions calculated from waste generated from 32% and waste recycled in 17% of properties based on property square feet.
Note 3: Category 6 represents emissions from air travel only
Table 2. Summary of Welltower’s Environmental Data for CY 2023:

Electricity, Natural Gas & Fuels Use Intensity1 19.46 kWh/sqft
Scope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions Intensity 4.91 Tonnes CO2e/1,000 sqft
1. Data covers properties within financial control boundary and downstream leased assets
2. Water use data covers 69% of properties based on property square feet
3. Total waste generated data covers 32% of properties based on property square feet
4. Waste recycled data covers 17% of properties based on property square feet
2. The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement.
Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. Consequently,
the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than the assurance that would have been obtained
had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

LRQA’s Approach
LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure. The following tasks
were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:
• interviewing relevant employees of the organization responsible for managing GHG emissions and ESG data
and records;
• assessing Welltower’s data management systems to confirm they are designed to prevent significant errors,
omissions or misstatements in the Report. We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling
procedures, instructions and systems, including those for internal quality control;
3 of 4
58
• verifying historical GHG emissions and Sustainability data and records at an aggregated level for CY 2023; and
• confirming that Welltower has documented their base year and conditions for base year recalculation, and
performed the necessary analysis to determine whether a base year recalculation is necessary. Welltower has
determined that the conditions requiring base year recalculation have been met and base year adjustment is
necessary at this time. Therefore, Welltower is in the process of recalculating their base year emissions as
required by their documented base year recalculation policy.
LRQA’s Standards, Competence and Independence
LRQA implements and maintains a comprehensive management system that meets accreditation requirements for
ISO 14065 Greenhouse gases – Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in
accreditation or other forms of recognition and ISO/IEC 17021 Conformity assessment – Requirements for bodies
providing audit and certification of management systems that are at least as demanding as the requirements of the
International Standard on Quality Control 1 and comply with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued
by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants.
LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and
experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior
management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent.
