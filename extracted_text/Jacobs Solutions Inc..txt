FY21 ESG Disclosures
GENERAL
GEN.1 Jacobs ESG Reporting
Jacobs has reported on a wide range of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues through our
annual ESG Disclosures since 2019. We have also reported on ESG issues via our Integrated Annual Report,
Form 10-K, Proxy Statement, and other public materials. This report is focused on our priority ESG data
that we believe is the most relevant to our business and important to our stakeholders.
This report is aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework and informed
by Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. Annually, we disclose toCDP (formerly the Carbon
Disclosure Project) and the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, (CSA), which is the basis for
the S&P Global ESG Score and a key factor for inclusion in theDow Jones Sustainability Indices. We
disclose ourclimate risk data in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
recommendations. We also regularly engage with leading ESG rating and ranking organizations to review
and improve the accuracy of their data regarding our ESG performance.
We understand and champion the increasing appetite for ESG metrics and transparency. We take a
pragmatic approach to our disclosures, focusing on what is material, what is a risk or opportunity, and what
makes sense for our business. We look forward to a consistent, industry-wide reporting framework that
serves the investor community and reduces reliance on lagging indicators—allowing companies to be
more efficient and focused on improving ESG performance.
This document covers activities in fiscal year 2021 (FY21) for Jacobs from October 3, 2020, to
October 1, 2021. Our FY20 report was released in January of 2021 and was last updated in July 2021.
Jacobs meets current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) climate change related disclosure
obligations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Jacobs will release an ESG disclosure document annually
and will make periodic updates as required by new SEC rules and regulations and as additional information
is obtained or to fulfill stakeholder requests for disclosures.
We apply an operational control approach as the boundary for our ESG reporting. On March 3, 2021,
Jacobs acquired a 65% stake inPA Consulting. In alignment with thegreenhouse gas (GHG) Protocol, our
investment in PA Consulting is included within our scope 3 GHG emissions data for FY21, which includes
GHG emissions outside of our operational control. PA Consulting is otherwise excluded from our ESG
reporting in this document. For more information on our approach to integrating PA Consulting into our
GHG emissions inventory, see sectionENV.6 GHG Emissions - Scope 3 (Indirect).
We also acquired BlackLynx, Inc. in November 2021 and Street Light Data, Inc. in February 2022. These
acquisitions are not included in this report because they were consummated in FY22. Additionally, ESG
and GHG data from our Joint Ventures are not within the reporting boundary of this report.
For questions regarding this document, please contact:investor.relations@jacobs.com.
GEN.2 Assurances and Verification
This document has gone through internal review by subject matter experts, legal experts and internal
auditors to confirm accuracy of the contents as of the time of publication, but only our GHG emissions
data reported here was externally verified, with limited assurance. In the future, we intend to obtain
independent assurance of additional data, including social indicators. This document and the data within
should be considered unaudited. Certain information reported herein contains estimates or is based on
assumptions. Furthermore, forward-looking information in the report, including our goals, plans and
expectations, involve risks and uncertainties that may result in our not achieving goals or cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. OurFY21 Form 10-K (pp. 21–46) contains a
discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from our
plans and expectations.

ENVIRONMENTAL
ENV.1 Introduction
As a recognized global leader in environmental and sustainability professional services, Jacobs holds
environmental protection as a core value, as expressed in theJacobs Global Environmental Management
Commitment Statement and as the cornerstone of ourPlanBeyond℠ Sustainability andBeyondZero℠
Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) approaches.
Our Office of Global Climate Response & ESG was established in October 2021 and reports to our
President and Chief Operations Officer (COO), Bob Pragada. The office acts as a connecting point for
Jacobs’ go-to-market solutions within the framework of energy transition, decarbonization, adaptation
and resilience, and natural resource stewardship, along with ESG advisory.
Globally, in FY20 and FY21 we achieved 100% renewable electricity for our operations and carbon
neutrality for our operations and business travel, as further described underENV.3 Greenhouse Gas
Emissions. We are committed to continuing these achievements.
ENV.2 Environmental Reporting
We report on environmental issues and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the public domain and
provide targets linked to these indicators. All environmental indicators reported in this document, unless
otherwise noted, cover 100% of Jacobs’ business locations. Carbon emissions were third-party verified
with limited assurance for all years reported. Other relevant information is available in ourIntegrated
Annual Report,PlanBeyond 2.0 sustainable business approach, and Environmental Performance Reports
for locations certified to ISO14001.
ENV.3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Our deep commitment to environmental protection and concern regarding the climate crisis led to
aggressive carbon emission commitments that are set forth in ourClimate Action Plan, first published on
April 22, 2020. Detailed in our Carbon Neutrality Commitment included in the Climate Action Plan, we
achieved 100% low-carbon electricity and became carbon neutral for our operations and business travel
in 2020 and continue to maintain these commitments.
Joining over 300 companies worldwide in November 2020, Jacobs became a signatory to theU.N.
Business Ambition for 1.5°C, an urgent request for action from the global coalition of U.N. agencies,
business and industry leaders, calling on businesses to set ambitious science-based emissions reduction
targets aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
Our 2020 climate commitments were a major milestone in our drive to address the climate crisis. In
keeping with our core value of “We Aim Higher” and the continually evolving guidance and best practices
for climate response, we revised our plan and targets. In our updatedClimate Action Plan, published in
April 2022, we commit to the following:
1. Ensure every project becomes a climate response opportunity.
2. Achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2040.
3. Maintain carbon neutrality status and 100% low-carbon electricity for our operations.
As a member of the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) Technical Advisory Group (TAG) since 2020 and
a participant in the Net-Zero Road Test in 2021, we committed to setting net-zero targets in line with the
SBTi Corporate Net-Zero Standard. Key requirements of the Net-Zero Standard include focusing on rapid,
deep emissions cuts; setting near- and long-term targets; claiming achievement of net zero only after
long-term targets are met; and investing in mitigation within and outside the value chain.

FY21 ESG Disclosures
We have approved near- and long-term science-based emissions reduction targets with the SBTi. This
means our emissions reduction targets are consistent with the aim of the Paris Agreement to limit average
global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century, compared to pre-industrial temperatures. They are also
consistent with the Net-Zero Standard.
Our near-term targets are approved by the SBTi as follows:
 We commit to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and
we commit to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from business travel and employee commuting
by 50% over the same timeframe.
 We commit that 65% of our suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services will have
science-based targets by 2025.
Our long-term targets are approved by the SBTi as follows:
 We commit to reduce absolute scopes 1, 2 & 3 GHG emissions 90% by 2040 from a 2019 base year.
In January 2021, we made a three-year commitment toCDP – an international non-profit organization
that runs a global disclosure system focused on environmental impact – as a supply chain member to
engage our suppliers, pinpoint risks and identify opportunities to support our suppliers in reducing
emissions and strengthening their climate resiliency. Jacobs was recognized onCDP’s 2021 Supplier
Engagement Leaderboard for engaging our suppliers on climate change and playing a crucial role in the
transition towards the net-zero sustainable economy.
We continue to be a member of the U.S. EPA Green Power Partnership, a voluntary program that supports
the development of new renewable generation capacity in the U.S. and requires annual use of green power
at a level that meets or exceeds partnership benchmark requirements. Thanks to our industry-leading
commitments and achievement, we are now proud to be one of the Top Partner Rankings as aU.S. EPA
Green Power Partnership 100% Green Power User.
We use the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting standard to calculate emissions using
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report emission factors. All GHGs,
including CO2, CH4, N20, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3, are included in calculations of metric tonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalents (C02e). We use an operational control approach as the boundary for consolidation of
emissions. We are using 2019 as our baseline year for all carbon reporting and carbon reduction target-
setting, and we are committed to publishing our GHG inventory (carbon footprint), which is verified by an
accredited third party each year with limited assurance.
In FY19, we completed the acquisition of KeyW. In FY20, we completed the acquisition of John Wood
Group’s nuclear business, Wood Nuclear Group. FY19 base year values have been updated to reflect these
acquisitions, as well as improvements to data collection and a better understanding of boundaries. In
FY21, we completed the acquisition of Buffalo Group. The emissions from The Buffalo Group have been
added to the FY21 inventory but have not been added to the FY19 baseline values because they are not
materially significant, comprising less than 1% of our total FY21 inventory. Table 1 summarizes our
commitment to carbon neutrality for our operations and business travel and reflects progress against our
science-based targets prior to and after the application of renewable electricity and carbon offsets:

[c] Includes full year of The Buffalo Group (acquired November 2020)
Note: Target base year annual emissions have been adjusted to include acquisitions per the GHG protocol standard. The total
emissions reported represent 100% of Jacobs' global operations.
Scope 1 emissions include stationary combustion emissions and refrigerant emissions associated with
owned office locations and mobile combustion emissions associated with owned and long-term leased
fleet vehicles. In FY21, we achieved an 18% absolute reduction in our total scope 1 direct emissions
compared to FY19, prior to applying offsets. Much of those emissions were likely reduced due to fleet
vehicle travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and we aim to reinforce reduced travel
moving forward across the business. We are implementing plans to reduce fleet vehicle emissions by
replacing older less fuel-efficient vehicles and purchasing more electric or hybrid vehicles.
Our North American fleet is our largest fleet and largest source of scope 1 emissions. Our North American
fleet manager has committed to obtaining 20% electric vehicles (approximately 400 vehicles) by 2030 or
sooner. As part of our tiered approach, we have also started to put telematics in our new vehicles, allowing
us to obtain vehicle diagnostics, including mileage, without manual intervention. Telematics also allows us
to be safer on the road by proactively addressing driver behavior including idling, harsh braking and
speeding, which have a negative impact on fuel economy. For model year 2022, all new vehicles will have
telematics. We successfully piloted this in 2021 for approximately 50 vehicles with great employee and
client feedback.
We measure our scope 2 indirect purchased electricity GHG emissions according to both the location-
based method and market-based method. Scope 2 emissions include purchased heating for leased office
locations and purchased electricity for 100% of our global operations. In FY21, we achieved a 20%
absolute reduction in our total scope 2 location-based emissions compared to FY19 baseline, prior to
applying green power purchases and carbon offsets. After applying our green power purchases, we
achieved a 91% reduction in our scope 2 market-based emissions for FY21 compared to FY19 baseline.
Most of our office space is leased, and we therefore have limited information and control over office space
energy consumption. To date, emissions have been primarily reduced through consolidation of office

space. We are implementing plans to further reduce office emissions by continuing to reduce office space,
leasing more energy efficient office space and working with our lessors on implementing more energy
efficiency measures and obtaining more accurate utility consumption data to capture those impacts.
The COVID-19 pandemic greatly impacted our FY20 and FY21 business travel emissions. Business travel is
our largest source of carbon emissions and, as expected, we saw a 75% reduction in our scope 3 business
travel emissions from FY19 to FY21, mainly due to COVID-19 restrictions on both domestic and
international travel. Our goal moving forward is to prevent rebound of these emissions back to pre-
COVID-19 levels. As we move to a new post-COVID-19 norm, we are committed to manage business travel
and employee commuting emissions in accordance with our science-based target reduction of 50% from
2019 levels by 2030.
Our verification statements are published on theJacobs Investor Relations ESG microsite,including both
ourFY19-20 andFY21 verification statements.
The emission estimates provided in the following sections reflect our annual emissions associated with our
revenue for each reporting year and therefore do not reflect the acquisitions until they occurred. This
methodology differs from the FY19 estimates provided in this section which have been re-baselined
according to the GHG protocol criteria which require adjusting the target base year to account for
significant impacts associated with acquisitions, divestitures, changes in methodology, or other events
necessary to provide relevant comparisons over time.
ENV.4 Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Scope 1 (Direct)
Our total direct GHG emissions (DGHG) scope 1 are summarized in Table 2. We purchased carbon offsets
to offset 100% of our scope 1 emissions in FY20 and FY21. After applying carbon offsets, our FY20 and
FY21 net scope 1 emissions are zero metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.

Scope 1 emissions include stationary combustion emissions and refrigerant emissions associated with
owned office locations and mobile combustion emissions associated with owned and long-term leased
fleet vehicles for 100% of Jacobs' global operations. Scope 1 emissions are estimated based on fuel
consumption and/or vehicle mileage and published emission factors.Our limited assurance verification
statements are published on theJacobs Investor Relations ESG microsite,including both ourFY19-20 and
FY21 verification statements.
ENV.5 Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Scope 2 (Indirect)
Our location-based and market-based indirect GHG emissions from electricity purchased (purchased and
consumed, for example, without energy trading) (IGHG scope 2) are summarized in Table 3. We purchased
renewable energy to cover 100% of our electricity consumption in FY20 and FY21. We purchased carbon
offsets to cover 100% of our purchased heating scope 2 emissions in FY20 and FY21. After applying these
green power purchases for electricity and carbon offsets for purchased heating, our FY20 and FY21 net
scope 2 emissions are zero tonnes CO e.

We measure our scope 2 indirect purchased electricity GHG emissions according to both the
location-based method and market-based method. Scope 2 emissions include comfort heating for leased
office locations and purchased electricity for 100% of our global operations.
Our commitment to 100% low carbon electricity means that our electricity needs are expected to be
supplied through a variety of sources globally such as green tariffs, renewable energy certificates (RECs),
energy attribute certificates (EACs) and virtual purchase power agreements (VPPAs). We are a partner in
the U.S. EPA’sGreen Power Partnership, a voluntary program, where the goal is to increase the use of
green power among organizations in the U.S. as a way to reduce the environmental impacts associated
with conventional electricity use. In the U.K., we purchase 100% renewable electricity through Renewable
Energy Guarantees Origin (REGO) certificates for all offices where we are directly responsible for procuring
energy. This accounts for over half of our U.K. offices.
In FY21, we began purchasing 100% renewable electricity through our utility energy providers in Australia
and New Zealand for offices where we are directly responsible for procuring energy and where certified
renewable energy was available. We purchased the remainder of our FY20 and FY21 global renewable
electricity through third-party providers of RECs or EACs to cover 100% of our electricity consumption
globally. FY21 renewable electricity purchases were sourced according to where our electricity
consumption occurs globally, as shown by megawatt hour (MWh) in Table 4 and Figure 1.

We do not have access to actual energy consumption associated with the majority of our 350+ leased
locations. We estimate energy consumption for most of our leased locations by using Commercial
Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data published by the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. CBECS provides average energy intensity use for various types of buildings in various
climate zones. This data, combined with the office size, is used to estimate energy consumption and is
subsequently combined with published energy emission factors to estimate associated energy emissions
for each office location. Including this data in our carbon inventory helps us develop strategies to better

understand and manage energy consumption and emissions in our leased offices. For example, we have
used this data to identify our locations with the greatest energy consumption and carbon emissions for
which we have begun or will start collecting utility invoice data or installing submeters, where feasible, to
better understand our ability to facilitate improvements in energy efficiency.
Our limited assurance verification statements are published on theJacobs Investor Relations ESG
microsite,including both ourFY19-20 andFY21 verification statements.
ENV.6 Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Scope 3 (Indirect)
We completed a scope 3 screening evaluation in 2020 using FY19 data to identify scope 3 sources that
are material to Jacobs and assess where we can make impactful changes. Based on screening level
estimates for employee commuting and purchased goods and services and our calculated emissions for
business travel, our four largest scope 3 sources include business travel, employee commuting, purchased
goods and services and upstream fuel and energy-related activities not already included in scope 1 and
scope 2. On March 3, 2021, we acquired a 65% stake in PA Consulting. PA Consulting was therefore not
included in our scope 3 sources when this assessment was initially completed based on FY19 data.
However, in alignment with theGHG Protocol, our investment in PA Consulting is included within our
scope 3 GHG emissions data for FY21. Once PA Consulting emissions are finalized and verified, we expect
to update our FY19 baseline to include PA Consulting and track progress against our SBTi net-zero target.
During the SBTi net-zero targets approval process, we added emissions associated with upstream fuel to
our scope 3 business travel and employee commuting, known as well-to-tank (WTT) emissions, to reflect
changes in the SBTi Net-Zero standard which differs from the GHG Protocol scope 3 standard. Our scope 3
indirect GHG emission estimates from business travel, business travel WTT, employee commuting,
employee commuting WTT, fuel and energy-related activities, purchased goods and services and
investments are summarized in Table 5. Our final limited assurance verification statements are published
to theJacobs Investor Relations ESG microsite,including both ourFY19-20 andFY21 verification

The COVID-19 pandemic greatly impacted our FY20 and FY21 business travel and employee commuting
emissions. Business travel is our largest source of carbon emissions, and as expected, we saw a
75% reduction in our scope 3 business travel emissions from FY19 to FY21, mainly due to COVID-19
restrictions on both domestic and international travel. Our goal moving forward is to prevent a rebound of
these emissions back to pre-COVID levels. As we move to a new post-COVID norm we are committed to
manage business travel and employee commuting emissions in accordance with our science-based target
reduction of 50% from 2019 levels by 2030.
Efforts to reduce our business travel carbon emissions were previously underway prior to the COVID-19
pandemic. For example, we created an employee dashboard so our people can view their travel carbon
footprint and be empowered individually to help us meet our global emissions reduction goals by
reducing their own travel and using less carbon-intensive meeting methods. Business Units are
accountable for tracking, monitoring and reporting business travel in alignment with this new reporting
tool.
As announced on December 13, 2021, effective January 1, 2022, we established an internal carbon price
of $50 per ton for all non-billable business travel to influence sustainable decision-making around travel
reduction and further help reduce our carbon footprint. The carbon cost calculated for every non-billable
business trip will be added to the overall cost of travel and charged to the applicable business unit.
Proceeds will be used to fund carbon reduction and removal initiatives.
Employee commuting estimates are based on Jacobs’ Human Resources data, including employee
numbers, worker location, worker type and worker status. Commuting estimates account for duration and
frequency of employees working from home due to COVID-19 based on generalized office count
information. Employee commuting numbers include all company acquisitions to the end of the fiscal year.
Estimates account for employee commuting mode (for example, passenger car, truck or bus) and
round-trip travel distances. Both are estimated using average data sources, as recommended by the GHG
Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating scope 3 Emissions, since no employee commuting surveys
with this type of data were performed by us during FY19, FY20 or FY21. Employee commuting estimates
are then multiplied by the appropriate emission factors to obtain total employee commuting emissions.
Emission factors come from the U.S. EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership GHG Emission Factors
Hub (April 2021) for U.S. data, the U.K. Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (July
2020) for U.K. data, and the WRI GHG Emission Factors Compilation (March 2017) for all other countries’
data. We saw a 73% reduction in our scope 3 emissions for employee commuting from FY19 to FY21,
mainly due to COVID-19 restrictions on our employees for commuting to our offices, requiring most of our
employees to work from home. We are currently collecting survey data from our employees to account for
actual commuting patterns and encourage continued reductions post-COVID.
We anticipate our science-based targets for business travel and employee commuting will be met through
the following:
 Increased use of video conferencing for internal and external business meetings
 Online versus in-person trainings
 Virtual professional and industry association conferences
 Reduced transportation vehicle emissions
 Alternative, cleaner transportation methods

Jacobs consumes and discharges water through municipal water and sewer systems to support our office
operations. Water consumption and discharge is not regarded as a significant environmental impact;
therefore, water-related goals and targets have not been established. In addition, very little data is
available, as water consumption is included within service charges from lessors.
Total water consumption is estimated using employee headcount data of those commuting into the office
for each year reported. Water consumption while teleworking is excluded. For FY20 and FY21, while the
total number of Jacobs employees increased, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of employees
commuting into the office and thus total office water consumption decreased.
Our water consumption estimates and planning are informed by the Resource Efficient ScotlandGreen
Office Guide and theWRAP Green Office Guide. We are working to collect more information from our
offices to ascertain actual water consumption so we can determine what is needed to reduce our
consumption in line with best practices.
ENV.11 Biodiversity and Natural Capital
All companies use natural capital, directly or indirectly, to support operations and growth. While our
activities at existing office locations may have an indirect impact on biodiversity and heritage resources,
they are not considered significant impacts regarding our own business operations. We have greater
opportunity to drive positive impact through the projects and services we deliver.
OurGlobal Environmental Management Commitment Statement includes a goal to protect species and
habitat biodiversity, heritage resources and wildlife. Potential significant impacts on biodiversity and
heritage from project design and delivery, depending upon the nature and scope of services provided, are
mitigated by our HSE processes, systems and subject matter experts as described in sectionSOC.12
Health, Safety and Environment - Management of this document. An internal Environmental Screening
Checklist was developed for use by Jacobs staff during field project or construction site visits where we
have responsibility for the work performed. Activities that present a potential significant environmental
impact or concern must be reviewed by a Jacobs Environmental Manager. This checklist includes
screening for previous audits, incident notification and reporting, site housekeeping, pollution prevention,
protected species and habitat, air emissions, land disturbance/excavation/stockpiling, stormwater
management, water/wastewater discharges, waterways and wetlands, and material and waste
management. We also protect biodiversity in our services by promoting green infrastructure solutions,
which harness the power of natural capital to provide ecosystem services, including biodiversity
consultation, to address resource constraints and challenges.
Furthering our positive impact, we engage in various external initiatives to advance nature-based solutions
and broader natural resilience. For example, we have a strategic partnership with Biomimicry 3.8,
providing “Project Positive” design solutions for clients.For more information on this and other thought
leadership contributions, see the “Nature as a Solution” section of ourClimate Action Plan.
Jacobs understands the importance of nature-based solutions and broader natural resilience in managing
societal challenges, which has been accelerated by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial
July 2022 Unaudited 16

Very limited data is available regarding waste disposed in our offices, as waste disposal is typically
included within lessor service charges. However, we do measure waste produced in our offices located in
the U.K., Ireland, Poland and the Netherlands as part of our ongoing ISO 14001 certifications. In FY21, the
ISO 14001 certification calculated that such offices produced on average the equivalent of 0.139 metric
tonnes of waste per employee per year; we use this number to estimate total global office waste disposal
by multiplying this average by employee according to global employee headcount data of those
commuting into the office for each year reported. Waste generation while teleworking is excluded.
For FY20 and FY21, while our total number of employees increased, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the
number of employees commuting into the office and thus total office waste disposal decreased. We note
that contractors have been excluded in the waste generation calculations because the third-party verified
data we rely on to determine the number of employees commuting into the office does not include
contractors. Going forward, we will continue to exclude contractors from future scope 3 water and waste
calculations. We are working on collecting additional waste data for those offices not included in our ISO
14001 certification calculation and will incorporate that data as it becomes available.
Resource Consumption and Waste Minimization
As stated in ourGlobal Environmental Management Commitment Statement, we promote circular
economy principles that encourage responsible resource consumption and the reduce, re-use and recycle
waste hierarchy. Practices described in our Waste Management Work Instruction require our Facility
Managers to evaluate source reduction and recycling opportunities within our operations and document
them in the Office Operations Manual and Sustainable Workplace Plan. It also describes project design and
planning requirements for Project Managers and Environmental Managers who evaluate source reduction,
reuse and recycling opportunities, using tools such as the Non-Hazardous Waste Checklist. Resource
consumption and waste minimization requirements are documented in a project-specific Waste
Management Plan or Project Sustainability and Resilience Plan as required in Project Framework for
Sustainability and Resilience and Project Sustainability and Resilience Plan.

locations are certified to ISO 14001 as necessary to meet contract or local requirements. We are currently
certified in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Qatar and the U.K., among others. Our
environmental management policy is integrated in our HSE Policy and is expressed in ourGlobal

ENV.15 Climate Change
Climate Change Strategy
We place the climate emergency and our response at the heart of our company’s FY22-FY24 strategy
“Boldly Moving Forward” and have established a central Office of Global Climate Response and ESG. This
corporate function acts as the connecting point for our go-to-market solutions in which our projects now
become a climate response opportunity within the framework of energy transition, decarbonization,
adaptation, mitigation and natural resource stewardship. Additionally, we are coupling climate response
with ESG, which is taking on heightened significance, both within our organization and externally as
companies around the globe rise to the climate challenge and address urgent social issues.
OurClimate Action Plan includes the headline commitments:
 Ensure every project becomes a climate response opportunity.
 Achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2040.
 Maintain carbon neutrality and 100% low-carbon electricity for our operations.
Our Climate Action Plan also includes commitments relative to climate justice, climate risk, nature and
biodiversity, and includes information and guidance on how our employees can take impactful climate
action.
We are committed to ensuring our people are aware of the risks and opportunities related to climate
change, so that along with our clients, we continue to mitigate risks from climate change, facilitate the
transition to a low carbon future and adapt our business to be more resilient and to thrive. In partnership
with the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, we launched theClimate Solutions Accelerator online course

to all employees to help them understand the role they can play in climate change action and continue to
develop the critical green skills and solutions needed for our continually evolving world.
Climate Risk and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Climate risk and resilience pose an urgent and important risk factor for us and our clients, and our
investors have confirmed their increased focus on the recommendations of the TCFD. As a supporter of
the recommendations, we have made four commitments in ourClimate Action Plan, that we continue to
meet:
 Integrate climate risk analysis into company strategy and planning.
 Deploy climate risk technology on all pursuits and projects where climate risk is considered material.
 Support our clients and suppliers to undertake their own climate risk assessments, in line with the TCFD
recommendations.
 Integrate by 2025 climate risk and adaptation considerations into each of our market sector strategies.
For more information on our climate change strategy, including our approach, risk and opportunity
findings and next steps, see ourFY21 andFY22 Climate Risk Assessments.
Since 2020 we have conducted specific climate change risk and opportunities assessments in line with
TCFD recommendations.
Our assessments in 2020 and 2021 explored climate-related risks and opportunities to which we are
exposed through our operations and the projects and programs we deliver globally. The approach to the
assessment conformed with the international standard on risk management, ISO 31000:2018Risk
Management Guidelines and follows methods that are used by our climate risk specialists in our work with
our clients.
 Scope and context: The assessment focused on projects across the main market segments of our
People & Places Solutions (P&PS) line of business. These were from five of our major geographies:
Australia, Canada, India, U.K. and the U.S. The risk framework was specially developed for the
assessment. It enabled risk to be assessed with respect to a range of objectives, including health and
safety, client relationships, regulatory compliance, reputation, and service delivery.
 Scenario analysis: Recognized and described risks that may prevent Jacobs and our clients from
achieving our objectives under our 1.5°C and 4°C scenarios – (RCP [Representative Concentration
Pathway] 2.6 and 8.5, respectively).
 Risk analysis: The characteristics of the risks were established, including their potential impacts,
consequences and the likelihood of the climate-related events that cause these. Controls that were
applied to reduce the climate risks, including those accounting for the effects of projected climate
change, were captured and risk was assessed with these in place.
 Risk evaluation: The combination of likelihood and most severe consequence were used to assess risk
severity.
Disruption to business for environmental end markets is a case study of a transitional risk we have
identified, assessed and are responding to. We could see business risks ($10 million to $100 million per
year) from disruption to major client revenue streams, and a similar loss of revenue from reduced services
for fossil fuel related projects. However, this is offset by greater opportunities such as emergency
management and national security ($10 million to $100 million per year), environmental planning and
permitting for extreme weather impacts ($10 million to $100 million per year) and civil works including
circular economy, waste management, clean energy and natural treatment systems ($10 million to
$100 million per year). Analyzing our markets revealed common themes and specific insights allowing us
to estimate the value of financial impacts to Jacobs.

Because we did not anticipate any material updates to the assessment conducted in 2021, we focused our
2022 assessment more on physical and transitional risks and opportunities, and on adaptation measures
in the water market specifically. In 2021, we identified the water market as having the greatest net
financial opportunity of all our market areas. Adaptation planning is also most strongly established in the
solutions we deliver within the water market, making this market well-placed to extend this proven
approach to our business planning.
Specific goals of the assessment were to:
 Pilot a collaborative approach to applying scientific and strategic insights into climate change and the
low carbon transition to understand key risks and opportunities for our clients and their implications for
our own business.
 Develop a proof of concept that can be repeated across other markets.
 Integrate ourOneWater thought leadership with an adaptive planning approach to define the water
management challenges that are unique to our clients, communities and our watersheds in regions
across the world.
 Develop a refined TCFD assessment that:
- Serves as a global example of best practice for understanding and managing climate risks and
standardizing climate disclosures in the water sector
- Strengthens our ability to support our global water clients with understanding the complexities and
importance of climate disclosures
- Guides development of TCFD assessment across all Jacobs’ markets
Our 2022 assessment further expanded on our IPCC scenario analysis used in 2020 and 2021, and we
adopted the Network for Greening the Financial System’s (NGFS) climate scenarios framework to map out
risks and opportunities specific to a rapid and orderly, and a delayed and disorderly transition to a
net-zero future.
ENV.16 Carbon Pricing
Carbon pricing is a way of recognizing that carbon emissions create a cost to society (for example, in the
form of climate change and air pollution), providing a financial incentive for businesses to transition to a
low carbon future. Governments implement carbon pricing through carbon taxes or regulatory schemes
such as emissions trading systems, and an increasing number of businesses are adopting an internal
carbon price to acknowledge the cost of carbon to society and help guide decision-making and
investment.
On January 1, 2022, we introduced an internal carbon price of $50 USD per metric ton of CO2e applied to
non-billable business travel at Jacobs. The carbon cost is charged to the applicable business unit. A
proprietary travel booking tool provides estimated carbon emissions and price for employee-planned
travel to influence travel behaviors.
The revenue generated by carbon pricing is directed into a Carbon Reduction Fund and will be used to
invest in initiatives, technologies and projects at the local, regional and global levels that address the
climate emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enable Jacobs to reduce its carbon emissions.
The Carbon Reduction Fund will be administered by the Office of Global Climate Response & ESG, and
recommendations for investment will be reviewed and approved by the PlanBeyond Executive Steering
Committee.

Since the release of our initial Climate Action Plan on the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020, we are
proud of our progress and achievements, including:
 We are the first consultancy and one of the world’s first companies with net-zero targets approved by
SBTi.
 We reduced our carbon emissions by 52% between FY19 and FY21, including scope 1, scope 2
(location-based) and scope 3 (business travel).
 We procure the equivalent of 100% low-carbon electricity for our operations.
 We are acarbon neutral organization.
We also recognize that much more must be done across our industry and our clients’ industries. Our latest
Climate Action Plan lays out our next phase of climate mitigation and adaptation commitments, which
build on the progress we have made. We are committed to continue driving the rapid decarbonization of
our operations and value chain, while also accelerating the essential shift to a zero-carbon economy
through the solutions we deliver to clients every day, worldwide. In parallel, we want to continue to
improve our and our clients’ business resilience by embedding adaptive measures across all our end
markets, considering climate risks and opportunities in alignment with the TCFD.
Our Low-Carbon Transition Plan (LCTP) is summarized in the following paragraphs with links to relevant
detail. It includes our strategy for delivering this transition as well as the measures, key performance
indicators and levels of accountability integrated into our business to ensure success.
LCTP Governance
 OurOffice of Global Climate Response & ESG leads on delivering our climate commitments for our
business and clients, including overseeing our climate-related disclosures.
 Our PlanBeyond Executive Steering Committee is the governance body with oversight for climate risk
and the delivery of ourClimate Action Plan. This committee includes all members of the Executive
Leadership Team, plus our Senior Vice President for Global Climate Response & ESG, Head of Investor
Relations, Head of Enterprise Risk Management and Corporate Secretary.
 Climate-related risks and opportunities and ESG are integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management
processes.
 Regular updates are reported to the Board of Directors by our Office of Global Climate Response & ESG.
We established a dedicated Board ESG & Risk Committee in April 2021; the committeecharter provides
an overview of the group’s purpose and responsibilities. Our Board Audit Committee provides oversight
of the controls and processes related to material public climate disclosures.
LCTP Scenario Analysis
To ensure we are fully considering physical and transitional risks and opportunities from climate change,
we have applied two different types of scenario analysis. OurFY21 Climate Risk Assessment was based on
scenarios derived from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the IPCC. We
considered risks and opportunities associated with:
 Successful implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change to limit global temperature
change during this century to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
 Continued high growth in GHG emissions leading to average global warming of around 4°C by 2100.
This scenario broadly coincides with the IPCC’s RCP8.5 scenario (from its Fifth Assessment Report,
AR5).
To further explore potential transitional risks from climate change for our FY22 Climate Risk Assessment,
we adopted the Network for Greening the Financial System’s (NGFS) climate scenariosframework. The
July 2022 Unaudited 21
FY21 ESG Disclosures
NGFS framework provides a set of harmonized transition pathways and, unlike other climate models, it
includes metrics that are key to understanding the prolonged and chronic impacts of climate change on
regions and on GDP.
For our FY22 climate risk assessment, we considered two of the four scenarios, Orderly and Disorderly:
 The Orderly scenario assumes climate policies are introduced early and become gradually more
stringent. Our first scenario anticipated net-zero greenhouse gas emissions being achieved by 2050
and global warming being limited to 1.5°C. As highlighted by the IPCC in AR6, this expression of the
orderly scenario would require a rapid low- or zero- carbon transition (that is, commencing
immediately).
 The Disorderly scenario assumes effective climate policies are not introduced globally until after 2030.
Because actions are taken relatively late and limited by available technologies (including limited
assistance of carbon dioxide recovery), emissions reductions post 2030 need to be sharper than in the
orderly scenario to limit warming. The delayed transition almost certainly leads to greater warming
(and hence physical risk) than a rapid and orderly scenario, but with lower early transition risk.
Our IPCC and NGFS scenario analysis outcomes can be found in ourFY21 andFY22 Climate Risk
Assessments.
LCTP Financial Planning and Analysis
We evaluate our project outcomes and estimate our revenue in alignment with ESG, grounded in the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 underlying targets. Our project
classification system is founded on a Market-Submarket-Project Category hierarchical taxonomy,
providing a consistent framework for evaluation over time. We disclosed the results of our FY21 revenue
assessment in alignment with ESG, with the results broken down by market and disclosed in our March
2022 company strategypresentation. The project classification system has undergone refinement in
FY22, with the intention of increasing data confidence and facilitating ongoing improvements for future
reporting.
For details on how our climate-related risks and opportunities may impact our company’s business model,
strategy and outlook, see ourFY21 andFY22 Climate Risk Assessments.
LCTP Value Chain Engagement and Initiatives
LCTP Supply Chain Engagement
In January 2021, we made a 3-year commitment to CDP as a supply chain member to engage our
suppliers, pinpoint risks and identify opportunities to support our suppliers in reducing carbon emissions
and strengthening their climate resiliency. We were recognized on CDP’s2021 Supplier Engagement
Leaderboard for engaging our suppliers on climate change and “playing a crucial role in the transition
towards the net-zero sustainable economy.” For more details on our supply chain management, refer to
sectionGOV.2 Supply Chain of this document.
LCTP Employee Engagement
We know that every employee must take responsibility for driving sustainability and climate action,
regardless of their role. We are building a Jacobs where our entire workforce considers sustainability a
cultural imperative, and every employee is empowered to contribute meaningfully toward climate action.
In the year leading up to COP26, our employees were encouraged and incentivized to take part in the
Climate Countdown Challenge through our employee engagement and education platform,Collectively℠.
Over twelve months, 1,000 employees completed more than 13,000 positive actions to reduce their
carbon footprint, saving the equivalent of 320,000 kilograms of CO2.
We also launched theClimate Solutions Accelerator course to our global workforce, supporting the
company’s learning culture for future green skills in climate response. A collaboration between theRoyal

FY21 ESG Disclosures
Scottish Geographical Society, University of Edinburgh, University of Stirling and the Institute of Directors
Scotland, the course provides a quick, simple and rounded introduction to the fundamentals of climate
change. Jacobs’ business units are now required to report user completion rates on a quarterly basis.
For more information on our employee engagement activities, seePlanBeyond 2.0 and ourClimate Action
Plan.
LCTP Products & Services
We consider our low-carbon "product" as the range of solutions we provide that support the low-carbon
transition across our end markets (that is, spanning digital products to professional services, or a
combination of both). We have over 400 subject matter experts providing low- and zero-carbon related
services, and over 16,000 practitioners across our water, environment and energy markets who support
other low carbon and sustainability projects, including ESG advisory, sustainability strategy, emissions
accounting and transition planning.
We partner with a range of government agencies, municipalities, private sector companies, and leading
environmental organizations to deliver resource management, sustainability services and proven industry
expertise on infrastructure initiatives around the globe. Our teams are actively working on finding
financially feasible options for our clients to reduce the embedded and operational carbon footprints of
buildings, roads, water systems and other infrastructure through greener building materials, reduced
quantities of materials, and designs that maximize energy efficiency and minimize waste.
We estimate that our FY21 ESG-related revenue is approximately $6 billion. This is a broader definition
than just our low- and zero-carbon related solutions and includes work across the following markets: clean
and affordable energy, air quality, environmental management, environmental planning for
transportation, public and mass transit, water resource management, supply and treatment,
environmental science, wastewater treatment, sustainable buildings and cities, hazardous waste, and
nuclear waste remediation. For more information on our ESG revenue, see our Investor Roadshow
materials (March 2022) onJacobs’ Investor Relations microsite, including both ourFY19-20 andFY21
verification statements.
Our Global Sustainability and Climate Action Practice focuses on key service areas that enable our clients
to envision and achieve the most ambitious sustainability and climate action goals. These services include
sustainable performance improvement, carbon management and reporting, net zero facility, campus, and
city design; utility scale renewable energy; distributed renewable energy; energy storage integration; and
corporate decarbonization. We help our clients establish their baselines and create strategies to achieve
their goals, ultimately improving performance while also saving costs and resources. Additionally, our
Solutions and Technology experts have indirect influence to incorporate low or no carbon products and
solutions into consulting and capital projects worldwide, especially in municipal water, transportation, and
waste systems. Climate Response is foundational to our2022–2024 company strategy “Boldly Moving
Forward,” and we continue to invest in building an agile, digitally-enabled workforce to combat the climate
crisis, delivering end-to-end solutions that we co-create with our clients.
Our Operations and Maintenance staff are continually seeking ways to reduce energy use and process GHG
emissions as we provide operational management of water and wastewater, utility and other systems for
clients such as local governments and defense agencies. For example, our recent partnership withPalantir
enables us to aggregate and analyze plant data to manage and optimize water and wastewater treatment
plant operations and maintenance, aimed at reducing costs and improving plant performance.
Our environmental solutions team is working with many clients on cutting-edge technology for
contaminated site remediation and integrated waste management. Experts in our climate risk and
resiliency practice support clients in managing the impacts of climate change, which includes the broad
use of natural infrastructure solutions to build carbon sinks as engineered solutions for flood protection.
We know resilience is an attribute of a smarter planet and requires planning and adapting ahead of
potential threats like hurricanes, crumbling bridges and global pandemics. We help our clients survive,
recover, adapt and thrive through change, no matter what adversities they experience.

LCTP Client / Customer Engagement
We routinely advise clients on energy transition and energy efficiency opportunities, including conducting
energy audits, and on securing low-carbon power supplies and developing onsite renewable generation.
Our teams are also actively working to help build green economies throughout the globe, including focus
on new hydrogen production technologies and connecting those producers with green energy suppliers
and end users for the avoidance of carbon-based fuels.
For specific project examples demonstrating our range of low-carbon products and services, see our
FY21 Integrated Annual Report "We Aim Higher" section and our2021 ESG Investor Presentation.
To support our clients in achieving their sustainability objectives, we have also developed a number of
sustainability-focused digital products, including:
 Evolve, our tool for breaking down the global themes and issues captured in the U.N. SDGs into more
practical, tangible and measurable project- and program-level commitments that help educate and
inspire our teams to deliver SDG-focused actions.
 Climate Risk Manager, a cloud-based platform that brings together global climate data and location
intelligence, giving users visual risk assessments, so they can make faster and more accurate decisions
on where to invest limited resources and guard against climate risks.
 Value Plus, an internal online platform that enables us to record, quantify and report the value-adding
activities we deliver to our clients. Savings can be recorded in terms of financial costs, carbon
emissions, energy consumption, waste avoidance, green building certification, and community and
social benefits.
LCTP Direct Operations
Our direct scope 1 emissions relate to our vehicle use and energy consumption for those offices of which
we have direct control. Our indirect scope 2 emissions comprise emissions associated with electricity and
heating purchased by Jacobs for leased offices. Refer to ourClimate Action Plan and sections
ENV.4 Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Scope 1 (Direct) andENV.5 Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Scope 2
(Indirect) of this document for detail on our ongoing scope 1 and scope 2 emissions reduction activities.
LCTP Policy Engagement
In alignment with our climate ambitions and strategy, we engage with a range of government, non-profit,
industry group and multi-stakeholder organizations to accelerate climate response, including those at the
local, national and international levels. Examples include our strategic partnership with the World Climate
Forum, World Economic Forum Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
Green Power Partnership, The Climate Registry’s Net-Zero Portal, Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi’s)
Technical Advisory Group (TAG), U.K. Pledge to Net Zero initiative, Business in the Community Net Zero
Taskforce, and UN Global Compact CFO Coalition for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
We are also a supporter of the United Nations’ Race to Zero campaign and the Business Ambition for
1.5°C commitment. We make efforts to align our policy engagement with the goals of the Paris Agreement
to ensure we are on a net-zero trajectory, while also encouraging and partnering with others to achieve a
net-zero future. In June 2022, we submitted a publiccomment in response to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed rule: The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related
Disclosures for Investors.

ENV.18 Environmental Impact in Project Design and Delivery
We prioritize and embed environmental considerations into the way we deliver projects and solutions
through a variety of tools, platforms and processes. Our integrated Business Management System (BMS)
establishes the “one Jacobs way” to ensure consistency and efficiency in internal operations, sales and
project delivery. Through our HSE Program and BMS, we implement an environmental management
system that conforms to ISO 14001 and is integral to delivery of all project phases, including siting,
design, construction and operation. Our sustainability process within the BMS was developed to provide
rigor and drive progress by embedding sustainability into our end-to-end project delivery process; it
includes global policies, procedures and resources to equip our people to achieve positive environmental
and social impact across our range of client solutions.
At the onset of project pursuits, we use a Client Success Platform to tag business opportunities that align
with the U.N. SDGs. We are also enhancing our evaluation of ESG risks in the go/no-go decision-making
process for project opportunities.
Once we are engaged to deliver a project, environmental aspects and potential impacts are further
identified, categorized and prioritized via our environmental risk assessment process and proprietary risk
register tool. Potential environmental risks may include, but are not limited to, ecological impacts,
biodiversity impacts, emissions to air, discharges to water, slope disturbance, soil disturbance and erosion,
storm water management, waste management, natural resource consumption, and hazardous chemical
usage. This process is global, and adjustments are made to address requirements specific to business unit,
regional and project differences. Results of this analysis are logged in the Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Plan (RAMP) tool. As a priority on our delivery of major projects and programs, the inclusion of climate
and natural hazard and resilience risk assessments, as well as adaptation, mitigation and decarbonization
planning is recommended.
After the project environmental assessment is conducted, significant impacts are addressed in an
environmental plan (typically integrated into the project HSE plan), which is required by us for all field
projects. The environmental plan addresses all identified adverse environmental impacts such as waste
management, reducing biodiversity impacts, emissions to air, discharges to water, natural resource
consumption, and hazardous chemical usage. The plan sets environmental objectives and targets for the
project, which are monitored, reported and reviewed periodically, depending on the project duration. Legal
requirements, including national, state, local and project-specific permit conditions, establish minimum
project expectations in the plan.
Internal audits are conducted to verify compliance with Sustainability and HSE plans and processes. They
are scheduled by the Region or Business Unit HSE Lead following the Audit Schedule Work Instruction,
with the level and frequency determined by the risk profile, performance trends, client feedback and
requirements for external accreditation or management system certification. Audits are conducted by the
Audit Manager following our Audits Procedure and logged in our Audits application for tracking.
Corrective actions are logged in our CAPA application for tracking to ensure actions are properly
implemented before closeout.

FY21 ESG Disclosures
Additionally, it is now required for Jacobs project teams to develop Sustainability and Resilience Plans as
part of the project execution planning stage. The project team is required to set specific goals and assign a
Sustainability Lead to monitor performance and influence sustainable decision-making throughout the
project delivery. Our Evolve tool provides the ability for project teams to evaluate project scope and
provide recommendations on specific key performance indicators to track and measure progress aligned
with the U.N. SDGs.
To further propel the integration of environmental considerations in project delivery, we recently
onboarded 12 Sustainability Leads across our two lines of business. In partnership with our corporate ESG
team, these leads help educate, spread awareness, and drive adoption of the sustainability requirements
within the BMS andPlanBeyond 2.0 sustainable business objectives across our global project portfolio.

SOCIAL
SOC.1 Introduction
At Jacobs we put people at the heart of our business. We have an unparalleled focus on inclusion, with a
diverse team of visionaries, thinkers and doers. We embrace all perspectives, collaborating to make a
positive impact across the communities in which we live, work and play. We invest in our people,
prioritizing initiatives to help them develop their capabilities and careers, improve wellbeing, and increase
flexibility and creativity. And we make decisions guided by our values: We do things right. We challenge
the accepted. We aim higher. We live inclusion.
SOC.2 Employee Engagement
We are committed to fostering a culture in which our people feel celebrated, supported and heard,
empowering them to deliver extraordinary solutions to solve our clients’ toughest problems. We
understand that culture is a key component of an employee’s decision to remain and stay engaged with an
organization, and we have made investment in our culture a top priority. We endeavor to continuously
evaluate and build upon our employees’ understanding of and commitment to our values, culture,
strategy and brand through various mechanisms, including global surveys.
Culture Survey – Methodology
In FY21 our people took the time to share honest, unfiltered feedback in our confidential Culture Survey.
Building on the methodology of our FY19 Brand Survey, our FY21 Culture Survey expanded our focus
from brand awareness and engagement to cultural alignment and engagement, broadening the scope of
dimensions assessed. The survey was sent to all Jacobs employees, and we obtained a participation rate of
50% of our global workforce, representing all lines of business and regions of operation.
We measured employee engagement based on two key index questions, which were also used in our FY19
Brand Survey to calculate engagement: on a scale of 1 to10, with 1 being lowest understanding or
commitment and 10 being the highest, (1)how well do you understand Jacobs’ values? and (2)how
committed are you to Jacobs’ values?Active engagement was defined as when an employee selects a
value greater than or equal to 8 for both questions. Additionally, the survey assessed 18 key dimensions
that were reflective of Jacobs’ culture and employee engagement, with examples including: alignment and
accountability, employee experience and trust.
Culture Survey – Key Findings
The results of our Culture Survey were overwhelmingly positive, with the majority of respondents feeling
connected to our values, inspired by our culture of integrity, safety and inclusion—and proud to be part of
Jacobs. As summarized in Table 13, our FY21 Culture Survey results showed that 62% of Jacobs
employees are “actively engaged,” a notable increase from the 40% of “actively engaged” employees
based on the same methodology in our FY19 Brand Survey. We take pride in this improvement,
particularly given the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and increased remote workforce.
We performed dynamic and cross-sectional analysis of our FY21 Culture Survey results to understand
trends and correlations between employees’ age, company tenure, diversity status, business unit, region
and other categories in comparison to their self-reported understanding of company strategy, alignment
with company values, sense of belonging and beyond, all of which factor into our ability to retain talent.
Based on this analysis, we identified several key cultural strengths, including integrity and safety, pride in
Jacobs, connection to company values, inclusion and diversity, flexible remote working, and mental health
commitments. Additionally, we identified six priority areas to continue improving upon our culture and
level of employee engagement. These included evolving and embedding Jacobs’ strategy, emphasizing
employee wellbeing, accelerating digital employee experience, strengthening leadership accountability,
demystifying employee networks, and living inclusion every day.
July 2022 Unaudited 27
FY21 ESG Disclosures
Culture Survey – Action Planning & Next Steps
For each strategic priority area, we developed detailed action plans and identified executive sponsors to be
visible champions in driving progress. Our Senior Leadership Team is responsible and accountable for
ensuring we make improvements, and we cascaded survey results to team leaders globally, tailored to
their specific regions and business units to inform planning and decision-making regarding their people.
To further foster transparency across the organization and showcase how employee voice is shaping the
future of Jacobs’ culture, we shared the survey results, follow up priorities and action plans with all
employees via channels including global townhalls, email communications, and targeted briefings from
team leaders and HR partners. All employees also had access to a dashboard so they could personally
review results.
To continually evaluate progress in the six strategic priority areas and identify new opportunities for
growth, we will conduct smaller, periodic pulse surveys, with the first deployed in January 2022. We will
analyze these results to measure performance against our action plans and inform decision making to
continue enhancing culture and employee engagement.

SOC.3 Inclusion and Diversity – Strategy
Creating a Culture of Belonging
At Jacobs, we are committed to creating a culture of belonging where everyone can thrive — a culture that
we call TogetherBeyond℠. Creating this culture allows us to recruit and retain the best global talent and
drive innovative solutions for our business, clients and communities. Through TogetherBeyond, we tackle
topics that are important to our employees such as equality, conscious inclusion and allyship. While
providing training and resources to our people is important – over 97% of them have completed our
Advocate & Ally inclusion learning program – equally effective are the regular authentic and courageous
conversations the members across oureight grassroots employee networks are creating around these
topics.
We are committed to holding all leaders accountable to making sure that broad-based diversity is
reflected in their own teams, using data analytics to measure our progress with the same rigor and
transparency as our financial performance metrics. Inclusive behaviors are now a key formal component of
all our leaders’ performance and salary reviews, and all leaders at Vice President (VP) level and above are
required to mentor two or more junior members of staff, at least one of whom must have a different lived
experience from themselves (for example, on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sex,
sexual orientation, geography, disability or veteran status).
With this framework in place, we can be confident of delivering on bold, aspirational goals such as those of
our 2025 aspirational 40:40:20 goal (40% men, 40% women and 20% any gender) to ensure we are
propelling a new generation of diverse visionary thinkers throughout our company.

Action Plan for Advancing Justice & Equality
Our focus on creating equal opportunities within Jacobs, including among historically underrepresented
groups, continues to increase as we deliver on the promises laid out in last year’s globalAction Plan for
Advancing Justice and Equality. In alignment with TogetherBeyond, this plan sets actionable initiatives and
measurable objectives to address embedded and systemic racial inequities across three pillars: (1) amplify
a culture of belonging; (2) recruit, retain and advance Black employees based on merit; and (3) contribute
to structural change in the broader society.
This third pillar includes a commitment to donate $10M over the next five years in support of Black
educational and professional development and scholarship opportunities. We have made progress
delivering on this goal, including contributions designed to tangibly benefit the Black community and help
create a new generation of Black talent through targeted Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and
Mathematics (STEAM) programs. Examples include a partnership withSEED LA’s new campusin South
Los Angeles, scholarships for outstanding Black students at the University of Connecticut and with the
Cowrie Scholarship Foundationin the U.K., and a Tier 1 partnership with Howard University where Jacobs is
renovating a computer lab and creating five scholarships.
Attracting & Retaining Diverse Talent
At Jacobs, we understand that “inclusion” is a verb, not a noun. It means being transparent and taking
action on our statements, commitments and initiatives to drive meaningful, measurable change both in
our company and in the communities that we serve. It means creating a workplace where our differences
are accepted, celebrated and harnessed to bring the innovative, extraordinary solutions clients demand
from us, and to attract and retain a diverse team of visionaries, thinkers and doers.
We strengthened our commitment to developing and hiring the best diverse talent with organizations
including theNational Society of Black Engineers (NSBE),Black Engineer of the Year Awards (BEYA) and
Women of Color in STEM (WOC). We are a proud member of NSBE’s Board of Corporate Affiliates at their
top national support level. We also partner withSociety of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), the
Society of Women Engineers (SWE) andBuilding Equality, the U.K. construction industry’s leading LGBTQ+
alliance to further support our retention and recruitment efforts of underrepresented talent. We also
continue to work to recruit, develop and retain the best military and veteran talent, partnering with key
organizations like Hiring Our Heroes, Boots2Roots and HirePurpose. We are proud to have received the
HIRE Vets Gold Medallion for Veteran Recruiting.
In partnership with McKinsey, nearly 300 Black, Latinx and Asian employees are participating in Connected
Leaders Academy programs, which seek to create a unique learning environment and safe space for
sharing common experiences, while providing the participants with the opportunity to build their networks
and become part of a new wave of Jacobs leaders.
Our Black and Latinx employee networks, Harambee and Enlace, continue to lead STEAM outreach efforts
in the communities that we serve and are working to bring a new generation of diverse visionaries from
underrepresented and underserved groups into the industry.
In partnership with our Women’s Network, we launched gender-balanced interview teams, provided
flexible working arrangements, improved caregiver leave, rolled out our first domestic violence policy in
Australia and New Zealand, piloted a “Male Champions of Change” allyship program, and created “Bridge
the Gap,” a program that actively supports parents returning to work.
In addition to the above, we promote an inclusive environment for our diverse workforce via many
approaches, including:
 Offering Conscious Inclusion and Advocate & Ally training for all employees
 Incorporating inclusion as a key focus area in leadership development programs
 Investing in diversity recruitment
July 2022 Unaudited 29

SOC.5 Pay Equity and Pay Gap
As part of our TogetherBeyond culture, we are working toward an aspirational goal of 40:40:20 balance
globally by 2025 (40% male, 40% female and 20% of any gender). To achieve this, we recognize we must
have pay equity and continue to narrow our pay gap. We are taking a range of actions to continue
propelling a new generation of diverse visionary thinkers through the ranks of our company. Reflecting our
commitment to advancing gender equality, we were named one of the2022 Times Top 50 Employers for
Women in the U.K., and awardedEmployer of Choice for Gender Equalityby Australia’s Workplace Gender
Equality.
Pay Equity
We are committed to ensuring our employees are compensated fairly and equitably based on the roles
they perform relative to our Global Career Structure and salary scales. We strive for sustainable pay equity
practices to bring employee salaries in line with similarly situated peers and align salaries to market. These
July 2022 Unaudited 32
FY21 ESG Disclosures
practices set the foundation for our overall long-term strategy to attract and retain talent. We conduct
multiple pay equity and promotion reviews each year to support our efforts to compensate and promote
our employees in proportion to their efforts. In addition, we have an external consultant review our
program on a periodic basis and provide detailed results and recommendations. We are committed to
maintaining long-term, proactive approaches to monitor and resolve potential pay inequities, including
utilizing pay equity analysis tools, implementing a comprehensive global grading system, conducting
manager training, and engaging in continuous reviews throughout the year.
Pay Gap
We publish anannual gender pay gap report covering our U.K. business and highlighting actions we are
taking to advance equality across our workforce. In 2020, we published our firstGender and Ethnicity Pay
Gap Report, going beyond the statutory requirements by also disclosing our ethnicity pay gap results for
our U.K. workforce. Our ethnicity pay gap measures the difference between average hourly pay rates for
Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic employees compared to white colleagues’ average earnings. In Australia,
we submit an annual report to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency in accordance with the requirements
of the Workplace Gender Equality Act of 2012.For more detail on related activities and achievements, see
our2021 Integrated Annual Report;2021 Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap Report for England, Wales and
Scotland; and theSOC.3 Inclusion and Diversity – Strategy section of this document.
SOC.6 Collective Bargaining
In FY21 approximately 2000 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements,
representing approximately 3.6% of our global workforce.
We enjoy direct relationships with our employees and the flexibility to efficiently respond to the needs of
our people and our clients. As noted in Jacobs’Human Rights Policy, we recognize the freedom of workers
to associate or not associate with a labor union, and to collectively bargain when represented by a legally
recognized labor union, in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. This policy is available to our
people and the public on our external company website.
Jacobs’ Labor Relations Policy (JJ-EB-PL-6101-JJ) further details our respect for the rights of our people
to choose and make decisions regarding third-party representation, including our commitment to dealing
in an honest, professional, and ethical manner with employees represented by labor unions. As part of our
Business Management System, this policy and others are available to employees via our searchable
JacobsConnect intranet platform. We post additional information regarding employees’ rights in visible
areas within company facilities and work sites. If employees or other stakeholders have questions,
concerns, or grievances regarding their rights or company policy, they may utilize our confidentialJacobs
Integrity Hotline, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, via which reports may be made anonymously.
SOC.7 Employee Wellbeing and Support Programs
At Jacobs, we believe in the collective power that comes from individual wellbeing — and we define it
across four pillars: physical, financial, emotional and social. The culmination of these pillars promotes
optimum wellness. Rooted in this holistic view, our global wellbeing strategy is designed to support
employees and their families.
We evaluate our benefits and employee support programs on a regular basis, benchmarking against
statutory requirements and market trends. We apply the results to inform policies, programs and
partnerships to support our people worldwide. While specific offerings vary from country to country,
examples include paid dependent care and special leave, support for parents, flexible working hours,
remote and hybrid work arrangements, on-demand access to health providers and more.

FY21 ESG Disclosures
Parents and Caregivers
We offer paid parental leave benefits that exceed statutory requirements in various a number of countries
of operation. In the U.S., Jacobs’ maternity program provides 100% salary continuation of an employee’s
base pay for up to 6 weeks. Employees have the option to top-up their benefit by using short-term salary
continuation for additional recovery time. In addition, our Caregiver Leave policy (US-EB-PL-6441-US0)
provides up to 40 hours of paid leave to support eligible full-time U.S. employees when their presence is
needed to provide care and assistance to ill or injured family members, or to allow non-primary caregivers
to bond with their new child after birth or placement. Leave granted under this policy is in addition to any
time off granted under paid time off, vacation, statutory requirements or paid sick leave policies.
We actively support new parents returning to work with continued programming and resources. We offer a
virtual care resource, Maven, that helps employees navigate different pathways to parenthood such as
adoption, infertility treatment and pregnancy—as well as providing postpartum and pediatric services.
ReThink is another benefit, free to our employees, that provides our people and their families around-the-
clock access to tools and resources to help understand, teach and better communicate with their children.
In many new and renovated Jacobs’ offices across the globe, we offer dedicated Wellness Rooms, which
provide a private, secure, hygienic and comfortable place to support lactating mothers in breast-feeding,
pumping and storage. All Wellness Rooms are universally accessible and come equipped with a sink,
undercounter fridge, mirror and storage cabinets. Privacy is ensured by having solid walls enclosing the
space and lockable doors with vacant/occupied indicators.
In the U.K., our internal Bridge the Gap parental transition program supports working parents before,
during and after becoming a parent, providing toolkits, a parent-to-parent network, and other resources.
In India, we offer “crèche” childcare facility benefits and reimbursement of some childcare costs in
qualifying circumstances.
Flexible Work
Having flexible work options allows employees to tailor their work schedule and location to best fit their
specific needs. Our Flexible Work Arrangement policies enable eligible employees to have a reduction or
variation of working hours and days worked, or to work remotely. We also offer various stratifications of
work status, such as regular full-time, regular modified full-time and regular part-time. In parts of the
company, we have rolled out detailed flexible working handbooks to help managers have proactive
conversations about flexible working practices with employees.
Additional Benefits
Our suite of specific benefits varies from country to country to best serve our global workforce. Beyond the
topics discussed above, examples include:
 Paid time off and paid holidays
 Retirement benefits
 Financial planning and education programs
 Educational reimbursement
 Employee stock purchase plan
 Disability benefits
 Life and accident insurance
 Global giving and volunteering program

SOC.9 Training and Development
We know that the continued success of our business depends on maintaining and growing our base of
talented colleagues and creating programs that are meaningful to them. Across the board, we want our
employees to engage with others, excel in their role, and elevate their career at Jacobs through expanded
career resources and learning opportunities. Our unique employee experience platform—e3: engage.
excel. elevate.—is not just a system but a mindset for developing our employees through continuous
feedback and celebrations, aligning priorities, learning new skills and upskilling knowledge.
Career Planning, Feedback & Performance Appraisals
Our e3 Global Career Framework provides numerous resources to help employees at all levels of the
organization plan their career at Jacobs, including a structure that explains skills, competencies and
experiences needed to grow their career. We have included a simple process that walks employees
through each step of creating a career plan. Managers are provided tools to guide them through having
career path conversations with employees, as well as how to show support and encouragement through
the process.
Our e3 platform promotes an open feedback culture, allowing colleagues to recognize each other for
collaboration and performance year-round via online feedback engagements, providing a “360-degree”
view of performance with input from an employee’s line managers, peers, direct reports and other
employees. Our employees establish goals (“priorities”) and performance measures yearly in the e3
July 2022 Unaudited 35
FY21 ESG Disclosures
platform and receive annual performance appraisals which include multidimensional feedback and
systematic use of agreed measurable targets.
In FY21 97% of our eligible employees participated in their annual conversation about their priorities and
accomplishments. In between annual performance appraisals, employees also engage in mid-year and
periodic performance check-ins with managers to discuss performance, adjust course and follow up as
appropriate.
Learning, Development & Institutional Partnerships
We are committed to developing and upskilling employees at all levels of our organization and across all
parts of the business. Our e3 Learning platform provides over 20,000 training programs to employees
globally. The wide range of e-learnings helps employees develop a multitude of job-specific skills and
work toward certifications. The courses are searchable and have been catalogued in learning spaces to
highlight relevant and helpful content. These spaces include sustainability, innovation, inclusion,
leadership, project delivery, health & safety, quality, technical excellence and more.
In addition, we partner with universities and other external institutions to develop and provide enriched
learning opportunities to employees at all levels of the business. For example, in partnership with Duke
Corporate Education, we developed a culture alignment program via which more than 200 Jacobs leaders
received guidance and programming to strengthen inspirational leadership and the development of
inclusive, innovative teams, enhancing strategy engagement and execution across our global organization.
In partnership with the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, we launched theClimate Solutions
Accelerator online course to all employees to help them understand the role they can play in climate
change action and continue to develop the critical green skills and solutions needed for our continually
evolving world. And to encourage, support and retain our newest employees, a cohort of nearly 800
graduates from across the company participated in our Graduate Development Program in FY21. During
the first two years of their Jacobs career, these graduates receive on-the-job learning, coaching and
mentoring, as well as formal training
Our focus in FY21 on developing our employees and driving a learning culture has been recognized by the
Association for Talent Development (ATD). ATD’s 2022 BEST Award is the talent development industry’s
most rigorous and coveted recognition. The global program recognizes organizations that demonstrate
enterprise-wide success through talent development.

SOC.10 Human Rights
As detailed in ourHuman Rights Policy, we respect the human rights and dignity of people in our
operations, supply chain, and communities where we work. We prohibit the use of any form of child or
forced labor, slavery or trafficking of persons. Our approach is guided by international principles, including
those encompassed in the U.N.’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, International Bill of Rights, and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
July 2022 Unaudited 36
FY21 ESG Disclosures
Guided by our values, we have taken a variety of actions to respect human rights in our supply chain.
Within the Human Rights section of ourSupplier Code of Conduct, we detail human rights requirements
for suppliers, including:
 Respect human rights in your operations, supply chain and communities where you do business and
avoid any involvement in human rights abuses.
 Comply with applicable laws regarding equal opportunities, forced labor, child labor, human trafficking,
modern slavery, working hours, freedom of association, collective bargaining, recruitment and fair
wages.
 Treat all your workers with respect and dignity.
 Conduct all operations in a harassment-free and nondiscriminatory manner.
 Provide a confidential, anonymous mechanism via which workers may report concerns and provide
whistleblowers with protection against retaliation.
 Provide and/or cooperate in the provision of effective remedy when adverse human rights impacts
occur as a result of your activities.
 Never require workers to pay employers’ or agents’ recruitment fees or other related fees for their
employment.
 Never retain or impede workers’ access to personal identification documents and possessions.
Human Rights Due Diligence
We conduct due diligence to avoid complicity in human rights abuses, and we seek to avoid causing or
contributing to adverse human rights impacts through our own activities and business relationships.
Supporting our Human Rights Policy, we introduced an updated human rights prequalification
questionnaire into our supplier screening process. This dynamic, risk-based assessment includes questions
related to worker accommodation, identity documents, wages, recruitment fees, grievance mechanisms,
and beyond. More in-depth screening occurs for suppliers based on risk triggers including geography,
activity type and employment of migrant workers.
Human Rights Mitigation and Remediation
Whenever possible, we operate in a spirit of continuous improvement when engaging with our suppliers.
We have worked collaboratively with suppliers to raise the working and living standards of their
employees, providing coachingto facilitate understanding and alignment with our human rights
commitments. For example, we undertook assessments of suppliers providing support services to our
offices in a high-risk region. The supplier staff were foreign migrant workers living in group
accommodation, and our assessments indicated the conditions of accommodation did not satisfy our
expectations. As a remedial measure, we moved the affected staff to apartments with a higher standard of
living at our own cost. We also conducted an analysis of supplier staff salaries and detected stagnant
wages, although aligned with market rates. To provide additional support to these workers and improve
their quality of life, we made the decision to increase their wages at our expense.
In addition to internal efforts, we have supported clients’ efforts to reduce human rights risks within their
supply chains, including providing guidance and dedicated resources to support the development of
worker welfare policies, procedures and auditing programs.

Policy andModern Slavery Statement.

Collectively Program
In alignment with Jacobs’ purpose of creating a more connected, sustainable world,the CollectivelySM
program is our approach to corporate citizenship and philanthropic efforts. Uniting our 55,000 visionaries,
dreamers and doers in a single platform for giving and volunteering, Collectively allows us to amplify the
positive impact we make in our communities every day.
Through our partnership with Benevity, a leading company for online workplace giving and volunteering,
our people can support more than two million charities around the globe through payroll giving, paid
volunteering efforts, matching campaigns and company donations.
The Collectively program brings our purpose to life by enabling our people to truly live our company
values, so we can push the limits of what’s possible with community engagement. Real-time reporting at
micro- and macro-scale allows us to set KPIs to deliver on our strategic causes.
The Collectively program is aligned with four strategic causes, cross-cutting key U.N. SDGs and Jacobs’
company values and priorities: Inclusion & Diversity; STEAM education; health and wellbeing; and
sustainable development.
For more information on our Collectively program, including employee matching, disaster relief response,
charitable grants, volunteering, ambassador network and long-term targets, see ourCollectively Program
Strategy.
STEAM Volunteering
Jacobs’s Global STEAM Strategy is embedded intoPlanBeyond 2.0, and Jacobs has a STEAM goal to
achieve 50,000 STEAM hours by 2025 while also becoming an award-winning STEAM employer.
In concert with this strategy, Jacobs has launched its newSTEAM education program, called theButterfly
Effect. The seven-year program is now available to anyone internally and externally because the goal is to
provide equal access to young people to develop a deeper connection to sustainability. The program is
designed to create long-term and sustainable behaviors in young people under 12-years old by giving
them the information, knowledge and understanding needed to consider sustainability in every decision
they make.
The Butterfly Effect covers eight themes aligned with theU.N. SDGs:
 Water
 Plastics
 Waste
 Carbon
 Biodiversity
 Food
 Human Rights and Lives
 Jobs of the Future
FY21 Contributions
We are committed to giving back, engaging with communities and building enduring partnerships. In
FY21, we transitioned to an open matching giving program, meaning Jacobs matches employee donations
systemwide to charities of our employees’ choosing, up to a set user cap per year (excluding religious and
political causes). Throughout FY21, we supported disaster relief and significant days of importance across
the world through the generosity of our employee donations and associated eligible matching
contributions, and through company donations.

SOC.12 Health, Safety and Environment – Management
Health, Safety and Environment Management System
Jacobs operates and maintains an integrated Business Management System (BMS), which establishes the
“one Jacobs way” to facilitate consistency and efficiency in internal operations and project delivery.
Several key processes comprise the BMS, including our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) processes
and procedures. Our global framework minimizes documents required by all our operations and drives
consistent use of common work processes.
The Jacobs HSE program is designed to provide safe and healthful workplaces, prevent work-related injury
and illness, prevent damage to the environment, and enhance HSE performance and promote wellbeing
throughout the organization. Leadership expectations are communicated, and roles and responsibilities
are defined by assigning personal accountability for behaviors consistent with HSE values and objectives.
Continual improvement is built into the HSE program and associated processes.
Jacobs’ HSE processes are consistent with international HSE standards and practices, including ISO 14001,
ISO 45001, US Department of Labor Voluntary Protection Programs and others. Additionally, our HSE
philosophy goes beyond mere compliance with norms and standards, and we seek to be best in class and
have a positive influence on the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees and partners, on the
environment, and in the communities where we work.
The scope of our HSE Program applies to all Jacobs activities (as relevant) that are undertaken within
areas that are owned and/or controlled by Jacobs. The program is used in conjunction with Line of
Business (LOB), Business Unit (BU) or other requirements related to managing HSE within specific
operations. The term BU includes performance units, regional and global operating units, corporate
support groups, and similar units or groups.
Global Participation
Jacobs is committed to an overall BMS that integrates HSE requirements and expectations and facilitates
achieving HSE performance excellence. Participation at all levels is crucial and supports the company
culture to ensure consistent HSE performance improvement and excellence.
HSE Policy
Jacobs’ global HSE Policy is established and is signed electronically by the Chair and CEO of Jacobs and is
endorsed by the Executive Leadership Team. This policy reflects core HSE values in relation to the
strategic direction of the company and is prominently displayed throughout Jacobs’ facilities and included
in on-boarding activities for all new hires.
Our environmental policy is integrated in our HSE Policy and is also expressed in ourGlobal Environmental
Management Commitment Statement.
Because driving represents a significant risk to Jacobs, our Driving Safety policy establishes the driving risk
management practices and driving rules for all Jacobs employees to follow when operating motor
vehicles, emphasizing “the safest journey is the journey not made.”
BeyondZero
At Jacobs, we believe the wellbeing of our people is fundamental to our success. Our passion for safety
and our courage to care for one another and our environment inspires mutual respect. It is not what we do,
it’s who we are. We call it our way of life, BeyondZero®, our Culture of Caring.
We are proud that in our culture, our people go beyond following rules, procedures and processes. Our
goal is beyond driving statistics to zero. We believe our culture will make our people and communities
safer, more secure and healthier. We look for ways to recognize and mitigate risks, on and off the job. We
July 2022 Unaudited 40
FY21 ESG Disclosures
drive and promote healthy behavior and care for the environment. We have created a true culture of caring
where genuine concern for each other makes it impossible to tolerate unsafe, unsecure or harmful
conditions or behaviors. The principles of BeyondZero® that we live and stand by at Jacobs include:
 We empower and motivate each other to act
 We try to recognize and understand risk at all levels of our business
 We expect our people to demonstrate a visible commitment and responsibility for creating a safe,
secure and healthy environment
 We extend BeyondZero® to everyone we encounter including our business partners, our clients, our
families and our neighbors.
HSE Strategy
Our strategy,BeyondZero: To 2025 and Beyond, sets the direction and framework of action for improving
health, safety, environment, security and resilience associated with our operations, maturing our culture of
caring, and living our values. This strategy sets out two goals aimed at helping everyone play their part to
manage HSE, security and organizational resilience risks effectively and proportionately.
The first goal is getting everyone to focus on what will make the biggest impact to reduce harm. To
improve our ability to do this well and manage risks, we must help every employee to understand their
role, is able to do it, and plays their part. This is our second goal.
These goals are driven into policy, processes and programs so BeyondZero becomes so ingrained and
pervasive in the way we do things that it becomes invisible and indivisible from the rest of the work done
by Jacobs and its partners. To achieve this, the strategy outlines four focus areas under each of the two
goals.
Reducing harm through focusing on:
 Employee health and wellbeing at work.
 Operations with greater need: high risk and high potential harm.
 Risks being assessed and mitigated with consideration and inclusive of employee needs.
 Strengthening our BeyondZero culture, understand and manage risk through organizational
integrations.
To effectively reduce harm, we need to have the capability, and continue to build that capability in
everyone through:
 Engaging leaders at all levels to be visibly active in BeyondZero.
 Developing and sharing better data and insights to improve decision making.
 Boosting the BeyondZero ability of supervisors and managers.
 Empowering employees to be represented, engaged and to participate.
Leadership Commitment
Proactive management leadership and employee participation are central to our HSE program. Leadership
and employees at all levels are responsible and accountable for delivering on the commitments and
requirements of our HSE Policy. These commitments include:
 BeyondZero®, our Culture of Caring.
 Promotion of good health and safe behaviors.
 Creating and maintaining a safe work environment.
 Protection of the environment and prevention of pollution.
July 2022 Unaudited 41
FY21 ESG Disclosures
 Compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements, and conformity to applicable client and
Jacobs’ standards.
 Integration of HSE into Jacobs’ business systems and processes.
 Continual improvement of our HSE management system, performance and our BeyondZero Culture of
Caring.
We meet these commitments by:
 Identifying and mitigating HSE risks in our business.
 Establishing clear objectives, monitoring performance and continuously improving.
 Defining applicable roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for Jacobs’ personnel.
 Informing and consulting with our employees and interested parties on matters related to HSE.
 Verifying training and competency of employees.
 Empowering employees to stop work if safety or the environment might be compromised.
All Vice Presidents have formally acknowledged their commitment to BeyondZero and to establish
performance objectives to deliver on the focus areas of the BeyondZero strategy.
Supervision
Supervisors fill an important role at Jacobs. The Jacobs HSE Program is line-management driven, and as
such, the supervisor (and manager) has ultimate responsibility and authority for implementation of the
HSE program in their area of responsibility.
Worker Participation
Worker consultation and participation in the HSE program are both expected and encouraged through our
Culture of Caring as described inBeyondZero: To 2025 and Beyond. The term “worker” includes Jacobs
employees, agency staff, and Jacobs-managed contractors or subcontractors where possible so that all
employees performing work on behalf of Jacobs are able to participate. When employee consultation or
participation is required, it is included in the appropriate written HSE policy, procedure, or guideline.
Various systems are in place for employee consultation and participation, including, but not restricted to:
 Planning – Workers participate in preparation of HSE plans and Safe Systems of Work (described
below), identification and assessment of hazards and control measures.
 Emergency Plans – Workers participate in development of emergency plans, emergency drills and
exercises, and critiques and improvement to emergency plans.
 Audits and Inspections – Workers can participate as a member of audit teams and have ongoing
responsibilities in conducting and documenting worksite inspections.
 Incident Management – Workers are often consulted and participate in incident reporting, recovery,
incident analysis, and any resulting actions.
 BeyondZero Observation Reports – Workers play a central role in making HSE observations in their
day--to-day work activities as a means to manage risk and share knowledge, practices and concerns.
 BeyondZero and HSE Committee (HSC) Meetings – Many offices and projects have an HSC that meets
monthly to address HSE issues and improvements.
 BeyondZero Awards – Workers nominate projects and personnel for various HSE awards designed to
encourage and recognize proactive employee participation in the overall HSE program.
 StepBack – The StepBack program complements the work planning process, whereby employees can
step back from their activities to further evaluate risk and identify any additional hazards or impacts
that may be in the work area.
July 2022 Unaudited 42
FY21 ESG Disclosures
 Stop Work – Employees have the authority and are expected to stop work if they believe themselves,
other people, or the environment may be or are at risk, or otherwise do not clearly understand how the
risk is to be managed or controlled.
 High-Value Learning – Employees participate in identifying and communicating lessons learned and
High-Value Learnings related to their work so that others can benefit.
Additional worker participation activities may be identified in LOB and BU HSE processes, as well as
office- and project-specific HSE plans.
Operational HSE Control and Action Plans
Prioritization and integration of action plans with quantified targets to address those risks are completed
via operational management plans such as HSE plans. Systems and procedures are established,
implemented, and maintained to manage and control or mitigate identified HSE risks. The effectiveness of
controls is verified, and opportunities for improvement are identified and implemented during the
execution of work.
HSE plans are prepared for all our permanent offices or establishments, including laboratories, project
offices and temporary project or facilities accommodation, to identify hazards associated with each facility
and its location, other stakeholder HSE expectations and legal, regulatory and emergency management
requirements.
Projects or programs performing field or site work prepare a project HSE plan or a Safe System of Work
(described in the following paragraphs), depending upon the location, type and risk level of work being
performed and client or company expectations. Secondment projects must prepare HSE plans when
employees will be seconded into another organization either at an office or a project location.
Operational HSE Control standards provide a consistent framework for assuring safe work operations in
facilities and on projects, and the required standards based on scope of work and risks are specified in the
HSE plan for action. These standards are described in Jacobs’ Operational HSE Control procedure.
Additionally, the following processes established by Jacobs support the overall operational control of
work.
 Project Start-up HSE Requirements – Specifies the minimum HSE requirements for starting work at a
new facility or project site.
 Occupied Facility Siting – Specifies the minimum requirements for identifying and managing the risks
presented by the work environment on Jacobs occupied facilities at a specific location.
 Fitness for Duty – Covers fitness for work assessments and medical surveillance needs depending on
job risk assessments.
 Critical Risk Management – Outlines control of work for high- or critical-risk operations.
 Safe Work Permits – Describes the process used for obtaining and managing client managed or
company required Safe Work Permits.
 Safety Observation Report – Provides information on implementation and management of the Safety
Observation Report process.
 Stop Work – Provides the framework for the company Stop Work process to ensure that each employee
has the authority, and understands the expectation, to stop work if they believe that there is
uncontrolled risk to themselves, others, the environment, or the community.
In addition, LOBs and BUs augment these operational HSE Control requirements as needed based on their
specific organizational needs, regional, national, or local requirements, and type of work performed.
Additional LOB and BU HSE requirements are found in the Jacobs BMS.

Contractors and Contractor HSE Management
Contractors are qualified, selected, and managed in accordance with Jacobs’ Global Supply Management
standards including a HSE qualification (review and approval) as required by Jacobs’ Supplier Qualification
process. HSE performance indicators such as incident history, written programs, and compliance history is
considered when procuring Contractors. Contractors may be required to follow Jacobs’ HSE requirements
subject to contracting arrangements and regulatory needs. Where specified by contract or as required, the
review and acceptance of HSE plans for projects are completed between the Contractor companies and
Jacobs.
HSE Management Roles in the BMS clearly define roles and responsibilities and how safety is managed,
documented, and reported according to various parties involved. As detailed in the BMS, Jacobs may
contract to exercise certain HSE management roles regarding Jacobs’ managed contractors and may
monitor the contractor’s HSE performance to achieve contractual obligations.
Hazard and Impact Identification, Risk Assessment, and Incident Management
Potential hazards and impacts are identified and documented for all levels of work, including operations,
products, business developments, acquisitions, modifications, and projects. Hazards and impacts are
analyzed through formal risk assessments to determine the specific risk event resulting in the highest
potential severity rating, potential causes, impacts types, preventative controls, and mitigating controls.
Control measures, including critical controls, are identified and prioritized according to the hierarchy of
controls, and implemented to effectively control risks. A material risk is a risk with the severity that could
affect the viability of the business. The opportunity to prevent material impact on the business starts with
Material Risk Management.
Jacobs has a designated Enterprise Risk Management team that controls the process for managing risk.
that has developed a global framework for managing risk. The framework is in alignment with ISO31000-
Risk Management. Jacobs’ Risk Register is maintained by the Risk team from the outcomes of functional
risk assessments. Project Risk Registers, as required, are reviewed at predetermined levels in conjunction
with Material Risk, Major Hazard, and Critical Control owners, or otherwise following a significant change
or Significant Potential Incident, to reflect learnings to improve the risk controls.
HSE risk management is defined in the Jacobs HSE Risk Management procedure, which provides minimum
requirements for assessing risks, specifying and implementing control measures, communicating risks, and
monitoring the effectiveness or risk controls for facilities and projects.
Operational management plans, systems and procedures are established, implemented and maintained to
manage identified HSE risks. We have processes in place to verify the effectiveness of controls and identify
improvement opportunities during the hazard and impact identification and risk assessment process and
updated where required. Hazard/impact identification and risk assessment is applied across all levels of
work and completed by competent persons.
At the activity level, Jacobs utilizes a Safe System of Work approach which is a fit for purpose plan or
procedure that identifies all potential hazards/impacts and control measures or safe work methods
necessary to minimize risk. Supporting a Safe System of Work may include Safe Work Method Statements,
Job Safety and Environment Analysis, and task level hazard/impact assessments using our StepBack
process.
Jacobs’ BeyondZero Observations is a process utilized by all employees to intervene and report on work
behaviors and conditions inclusive of all HSE risks and opportunities. The process includes response,
notification and action management.
All workers are empowered to Stop Work. Jacobs has an established procedure that provides the
framework for our Stop Work process--each employee has the authority, and understands the expectation,
July 2022 Unaudited 44
FY21 ESG Disclosures
to Stop Work if they believe that there is uncontrolled risk to themselves, others, the environment, or the
community.
Jacobs has integrated procedures and processes for managing health and safety, environmental, motor
vehicle and security-related incidents. Requirements and responsibilities for the following elements are
specified in HSE and Security Incident Management procedures.
 Incident Response, which includes emergency actions, coordination with local authorities, and site
control actions.
 Notification, which includes immediate verbal notification to supervisor, and timely notification of
management, clients, government authorities, and other groups as necessary depending on the nature
of the incident.
 Reporting, which includes written reports, data entry to Intelex along with preliminary hazard
classification to initiate automated workflows.
 Investigation and Analysisof work-related injuries, ill health, diseases and incidents,which includes,
through the use of established processes and suitably competent persons, gaining an understating of
what happened, why the incident occurred and what actions can be identified to prevent it from
happening again.
 Communication, which includes communication of the incident and analysis findings to site personnel.
 Records, which includes written reports and inclusion of incident information and actions in the Intelex
information management system.
Occupational Health Services
Jacobs has specialized occupational health service providers and internal specialists to aid in the
identification of occupational health hazards and ongoing risk management where applicable.
Competency requirements are completed in accordance with Jacobs’ Competency Framework within
operations, along with identification of core HSE competencies, maintenance of a competency needs
assessment, assessment and verification of competency, and maintenance of competency records.
Service providers are assessed through Jacobs’ procurement management processes and are required to
achieve the standards and licensing/permit requirements applicable to them in the jurisdiction where they
operate.
We maintain personal health related information in accordance with Jacobs’ privacy and records
management policies and legislated requirements for the jurisdiction where we operate, for example, the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
Emergency Procedures and Plans
The integration of actions to prepare for and respond to emergency situations is managed via our Global
Resilience program. This process establishes companywide emergency management requirements
including Crisis Management, Business Continuity, and formation of Emergency Response and
Management Teams.
Jacobs’ locations and project sites prepare emergency response plans for potential site emergencies such
as medical emergencies, fires, spills, extreme weather, personal security threats and similar credible
events. These plans are typically included as part of the project or office plans, inclusive of health and
safety, environment, and security plans for the location and include emergency management information
based on the assessed risks at site.
Training to support Jacobs’ Emergency Management and Business Continuity commences with our
onboarding program and continues with awareness training available for all employees and required
courses for HSE and emergency and crisis management teams. It extends to local drills, annual scenario

testing and bespoke crisis training for regional and global crisis management teams, progressing
competency and capability. The business utilizes mass communications technologies to support a global
response.
Worker HSE Training
Essential and appropriate HSE training and awareness is provided to workers at all levels. Training needs
analysis is completed at relevant levels of the organization to establish competency requirements. This is
done via Jacobs’ HSE training categories which set out the minimum required HSE training for all Jacobs
employees, and ensure they receive the appropriate HSE training for the role they undertake.
All new Jacobs employees must complete the Jacobs’ On-Boarding process which has four steps. This
overall process was created taking into consideration legal requirements across the globe in generating
best practice compliance globally for HSE onboarding and is mandatory to ensure Jacobs is meeting its
HSE Duty of Care.
 Step 1: Pre-hire induction to specify key HSE programs and risk management approaches. Completed
by all new hired employees.
 Step 2: All workers complete online Global On-Boarding Module within the first week of employment.
 Step 3: Mandatory that all workers complete Jacobs’ global HSE culture training program.
 Step 4: Ongoing training needs, as well as training on specific work-related hazards, impacts,
hazardous activities, or hazardous situations, is completed at the operational level as per HSE training
categories.
HSE training for all employees occurs on a regular basis with consideration to risk management,
compliance and competency needs.
Promotion of Worker Health and Wellbeing
Advancing the health, wellbeing, and safety of society is one of our Sustainable Business Objectives
supporting our global sustainability strategy, PlanBeyond 2.0. At Jacobs, we believe that health awareness
and support go beyond just the workplace. Supporting our employees and other stakeholders at work, at
home and in the community can make a positive difference, and our Jacobs’ global wellbeing strategy
delivers an integrated approach that encompasses physical, emotional, financial, social, and workplace
wellbeing for all Jacobs employees and their families. Jacobs provides a range of employee benefits that
support non-occupational health, including a comprehensive Employee Assistance Program, Wellbeing
Program access, gym memberships, flu vaccination programs, health insurances, and local health and
wellbeing activities.
We believe positive mental health is a vital component of a safe, productive, and engaged workforce. Our
Mental Health Matters strategy is designed to raise awareness and normalize conversations around mental
health issues and provide training and a network to support one another. We actively support the positive
mental health of our people and our communities with a global program to:
 Provide every location with the appropriate trained resources to implement the Mental Health Matters
strategy.
 Empower every location to build their positive mental health champions network and eliminate the
stigma of mental health so that is becomes an integral part of our Culture of Caring.
As part of the program, we provide Positive Mental Health Champions, training our employees in how to
guide staff who have mental health concerns or crises to the appropriate level of help; support fellow
employees; and encourage positive mental health throughout the workplace.
Jacobs also utilizes its BeyondZero Observation application as part of our continuous improvement efforts
to monitor the performance of our mental health programs and to effectively evaluate, monitor, and
understand the impact of our mental health programs and overall mental health in the workplace.
July 2022 Unaudited 46
FY21 ESG Disclosures
By using the BeyondZero Observation application and selecting Mental Health, Jacobs employees can
engage with us on all our mental health programs—both what we’re doing well and where they see
opportunities for improvement. Employees can select the relevant topic(s), without divulging detailed
information. The Mental Health BeyondZero Observation provides an easy way for employees to provide
quantitative feedback on the matters that impact their mental health, from One Million Lives and working
from home, to our Positive Mental Health Champions, organizational changes, and much more.
In FY19, we established a target to improve the mental health and wellbeing of One Million Lives by 2025.
This is not only supported by Jacobs’ global wellbeing strategy, but also through our One Million Lives
campaign. Through our free mental health check-in tool,One Million Lives (OML), any person in the world
can accessmental health resources such as how to guides, conversation starters, useful contact numbers,
and FAQs. Jacobs actively encourages employees to use the tool and to share these resources with their
family, extended family, co-workers, and community members.
We maintain personal health related information in accordance with Jacobs’ privacy and records
management policies and legislated requirements for the jurisdiction where Jacobs operates, for example,
HIPAA.
Assurance, Governance and Evaluation of Progress
Effective management of HSE risks and issues is assured via the following elements:
 Establishment of a global BeyondZero Steering Committee to assist the Executive Leadership Team in
relation to Jacobs’ HSE management activities, including:
- Ensure the appropriate global HSE policies, procedures and activities are in place such that we meet
our general legal obligations
- Ensure the appropriate global HSE policies, procedures and activities are in place to effectively
mitigate our risks
- Ensure appropriate global HSE policies procedures and systems are in place to effectively manage,
measure and improve HSE performance
- Oversee the provision by Jacobs of a healthy, safe and secure working environment and culture for
all employees, contractors, clients and other visitors to our controlled work locations
 Prioritization and action plans with quantified targets for business unit managers
 Discussion of HSE issues and risks documentation between HR and managers' BU on a regular basis,
and between HSE department and the executive management/board of directors on at least a
quarterly basis
 Evaluation of progress in reducing and preventing HSE issues and risks against targets
 Internal inspections and consultations by HSE specialists
 Independent external verification of HSE programs for locations certified to ISO45001, ISO14001 and
OHSAS18001
 Targets embedded in performance appraisal
Internal Inspections
Internal inspections are integrated into Jacobs’ HSE risk management and operational control processes
to verify the effectiveness of controls and identify improvement opportunities. Operational management
plans outline inspection and monitoring requirements, as do Safe Systems of Work at the activity level.
Inspections in the form of ongoing monitoring occur through Jacobs’ BeyondZero Observations. This is a
process used by all employees to intervene and report on work behaviors and conditions inclusive of all
HSE and Security risks and opportunities. The process includes response, notification and action
management.

HSE Auditing
Auditing is a key component in verifying Jacobs’ HSE program implementation across the company and
identifying areas for improvement. Audit schedules are developed by organizational HSE leads (for
example, BU, regions, and global performance units) and approved by LOB HSE leads. Audit schedules are
developed based on factors such as risk, negative trends, and accreditation requirements.
Audit program implementation including selection of projects, auditor assignments, auditor training, and
recordkeeping is defined in Jacobs’ HSE Audit Schedule procedure. Additional audit requirements based
on geography, project type, client requirements and similar factors are included in LOB/BU and program,
project, or office-specific HSE processes as needed.
Management Review
HSE performance is reviewed on a regular basis within the LOB/BU and other organizational groups. HSE
performance is reviewed at least annually at the global and LOB level as detailed in Jacobs’ Management
Review procedure. Management reviews for other organizational groups are performed to determine that
the HSE Program is suitable, adequate, and effective. Identified corrective actions or improvements are
facilitated by group leadership and the supporting HSE lead as detailed in Jacobs’ HSE Performance
procedure.
SOC.13 HSE – Products and Services
Jacobs does not offer consumer products; we principally provide services and solutions to our clients.
HSE in Design
Jacobs undertakes a vast range of design services whereby our designers understand the risks associated
with the lifecycle of the asset and how design decisions can influence how assets are built, operated,
maintained and demolished. By considering the whole lifecycle of a project our designers can not only
improve the HSE benefits of a design, but also improve the health and wellbeing of workers, and reduce
potential environmental impacts, with greater efficiency of construction, operation and maintenance,
leading to reductions in program length and cost savings.
De5ign is Jacobs’ behavioral program driving a cultural shift in HSE in Design, which takes Jacobs beyond
base legislative requirements to provide a consistent approach to HSE in design across our global
business, maximizing HSE benefits across the lifecycle of our projects. De5ign is inclusive of the process to
identify and record the risks, use hazard identification/elimination and risk reduction assessments, design
hazard lists and red, amber, green lists, and to take residual risks as low as reasonably practicable by
consulting with all parties involved.
De5ign supports Jacobs’ design professionals by providing an HSE in-design toolset and integrated
training. The framework is scalable in application, ranging from small streetscape design services to
advanced research and development and technology industry facilities solutions.
De5ign supports and leverages Jacobs’ key BeyondZero and PlanBeyond strategies. Employees at all
levels are encouraged to challenge unsafe design and speak up when they need support. Our BeyondZero
Observation system is used to collect and share learning and HSE in design best practices. Our HSE in
Design reviews with HSE professionals drive tangible improvement to all aspects of HSE including
wellbeing, occupational and mental health. HSE in De5ign is integrated with our approach to digital
solutions, innovation, and technology to generate high value solutions for our clients and customers.

department and internal audit regarding hotline reports (to the extent not reported to another
committee).
More information can be found on our website here:Ethics & Conduct.
GOV.2 Supply Chain
Jacobs operates in 40 countries and engages more than 20,000 suppliers worldwide.
We have a publicly-availableSupplier Code of Conduct, which we have updated for FY22. When registering
within our global supplier system, suppliers must certify their agreement to our Supplier Code of Conduct.
The Supplier Code of Contact covers various topics, including, but not limited to:
 HSE
 Sustainability
 Quality
 Competition and anti-trust
 Bribery and corruption
 Inclusion and diversity
 Human rights
 Business ethics
Jacobs’ Supply Management is focused on ensuring project delivery, reducing overall performance and
supply chain risk, and building strategic relationships with our suppliers to help drive savings and meet our
key initiatives, including sustainability, human rights and diversity.
During supplier qualification, we gather data on financials, HSE, quality and technical capability. This
process is detailed in internal policies. Our Legal Ethics & Compliance department has a process for
identifying bribery and corruption risks for suppliers and other third parties. Factors include the Corruption
Perception Index (CPI) score, debarment list screening, desktop media searches, affiliation with
Government entities/officials, and years in business. The assessment is conducted via a third-party
background screening software, which uses external data points from sanctions lists and public news
sources. Indicators of interaction/affiliation with Government entities/officials result in a high-risk
classification. High risk suppliers undergo heightened due diligence, including the completion of
questionnaires, commissioning of in-depth background reports, and evaluation of any additional red flags.
We also assess suppliers via a human rights qualification questionnaire and certification process.
As outlined in ourClimate Action Plan, our Supply Chain Management and Procurement teams will
establish climate action goals for major suppliers, and partner with our suppliers to improve Scope 3 data
and target reductions. Through ourScience-Based Targets we have committed that 65% of our suppliers
by spend covering purchased goods and services will have science based targets by 2025. In January
2021, we made a three-year commitment toCDP as a supply chain member to engage our suppliers,
pinpoint risks and identify opportunities to support our suppliers in reducing emissions and strengthening
their climate resiliency. Jacobs was recognized onCDP’s 2021 Supplier Engagement Leaderboard for
engaging our suppliers on climate change and playing a crucial role in the transition towards the net-zero
sustainable economy.
GOV.3 Board Structure
Jacobs maintains information on Corporate Governance, including information on our Board, on our
Investors’ websiteinvest.jacobs.com. Also, refer to our2022 Proxy Statement for details on our
governance structure.
The Board’s leadership is comprised of Chair of the Board and CEO, Steven J. Demetriou, and Lead
Independent Director, Christopher M.T. Thompson. The Board has determined that having Mr. Demetriou
serve as Chair of the Board provides significant advantages to the Board and the Company, as it allows the
Board to benefit from his knowledge of the Company’s business and market opportunities and risks, and
July 2022 Unaudited 53
FY21 ESG Disclosures
also facilitates communications and relations with other members of senior leadership. The Board also
believes that having Mr. Demetriou serve as Chair of the Board is advantageous to the Company when
working with clients in certain areas of the world in which the title of Chair is significant.
Because the Jacobs Board believes that strong independent leadership is a critical aspect of effective
corporate governance, the Board has established the position of Lead Independent Director. The Board
believes that a Lead Independent Director, who has the responsibilities set forth in the Company’s
Corporate Governance Guidelines, provides independent leadership, oversight and benefits for the
Company and Board that would be provided by an independent Chair.
The current standing committees of the Board are Audit, ESG and Risk, Human Resource and
Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance. The members of these committees consist
only of independent directors. The Board may form and disband new temporary or permanent committees
as it deems appropriate, depending upon circumstances from time to time.
GOV.4 Board Composition and Diversity
Effective January 25, 2022, the Board consists of 10 directors. In addition to our Chair of the Board and
CEO, the Board is comprised of 9 independent directors. Although the role of our Chair of the Board and
CEO is combined, a Lead Independent Director has also been appointed.
Our definition of “independent” is detailed under “Guidelines for Determining Director Independence,” on
page 2 ofJacobs Corporate Governance Guidelines. The definition provides that it is expected that Board
members (in that role) will exercise diligently and in good faith their independent judgment in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole, notwithstanding their other activities or
affiliations. No director qualifies as “independent” unless the Board affirmatively determines that the
director has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder, or
officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company).
The representation of board members who are ethnically diverse or female is 50%. Of our 10 directors,
3 are female and 4 are racially and ethnically diverse. 50% of our directors are new since 2019.
Additionally, ourCorporate Governance Guidelinesexpressly require that diversity factors, such as gender,
race, ethnicity, country of origin, nationality, or cultural background be considered in the board
nomination process. As stated in our2022 Proxy Statement under “Board Composition”, the Board
believes it should encompass individuals with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. In accordance with
these Guidelines, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the diversity of
viewpoints, backgrounds, experiences and other demographics in evaluating and considering potential
director candidates. Diversity is an important consideration in the director nomination process because the
Board believes that people of broad diversity including, but not limited to, different genders, experiences,
ages, races and ethnic backgrounds and military experience can contribute different, useful perspectives
while collaborating effectively to further the Company’s mission.
GOV.5 Board Nominations and Conflict of Interest
Once potential director candidates are identified, including any candidates nominated by shareholders,
the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Lead Independent Director and
the Chair of the Board and CEO shall review the backgrounds of those candidates with the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is then
responsible for recommending a selection of director nominees to the Board. It is the Board’s
responsibility to nominate and, in certain circumstances (such as to fill vacancies that may occur on the
Board), to elect directors in consultation with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Directors are expected to avoid any action, position or interest that conflicts with the interests of the
Company or gives the appearance of a conflict of interest. If an actual or potential conflict of interest
develops because of a change in the business operations of the Company, or in a director’s circumstances,
July 2022 Unaudited 54
FY21 ESG Disclosures
the director is required to report the matter immediately to the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee and the Chair of the Audit Committee. If a director has a personal interest in a
matter before the Board, the director shall disclose the interest to the full Board and excuse herself or
himself from participation in the discussion and shall not vote on the matter.
GOV.6 Board Roles and Effectiveness
The primary responsibilities of the Board are oversight, counseling and direction to the management of
the Company in the interest and for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders and other
stakeholders. The Board has delegated to the executive officers of the Company the authority and
responsibility for managing the business of the Company in a manner consistent with the standards and
practices of the Company in compliance with applicable law, and in accordance with any specific plans,
instructions, or directions of the Board.
The Board oversees the Company’s approach to enterprise risk management (ERM), designed to support
the achievement of strategic objectives, improve organizational performance, and enhance long-term
shareholder value. In conjunction with management, the Board assesses the specific risks faced by the
Company and reviews the steps taken by the Company’s leadership to manage those risks. The Board also
provides guidance to and oversight of management throughout the year with respect to setting the
Company’s corporate strategy, which facilitates these assessments and reviews. The Board also
encourages management to promote a corporate culture that integrates risk management into the
Company’s corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations in a way that is consistent with the
Company’s targeted risk profile.
Pursuant to the Board’s instruction, the Company’s leadership regularly reports on applicable risks to the
relevant Committee or the Board, as appropriate, including regular reports on significant Company
projects, with additional review or reporting on risks being conducted as needed or as requested by the
Board and its Committees. In FY20, as part of the Company’s ongoing evaluation of its ERM program, the
Company undertook various actions to further enhance the effectiveness of the program, including the
following: Created a new senior management position to oversee the Company’s ERM program. This
officer provides regular reports to the Board. Engaged third party ERM expert to provide an independent
assessment of the Company’s risks, policies and procedures. Increased reporting to and feedback from the
Board, including a designated Board sponsor. In FY21, the new ESG & Risk Committee was formed to
further increase oversight of ESG and ERM.
Overall director attendance at meetings of the Board and its Committees was 100% during FY21. Board
members are expected to attend annual meetings of shareholders. All the members of the Board attended
our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders via the virtual meeting platform.

GOV.8 Management Incentives (Non-Financial Metrics)
In FY19, the Company introduced an individual strategic, non-financial modifier for the overall Leadership
Performance Plan payout for the Named Executive Officers (NEOs) and the other senior executives to
provide incentives and drive accountability for Company initiatives that drive long-term stockholder value.
In FY21, the modifier was changed to a stand-alone metric for the strategic non-financial initiatives and
was included in the incentive funding for all vice presidents and above participating in the program. Such
initiatives include inclusion and diversity, sustainability, improvements in talent retention, driving
innovation across the business, safety and operational excellence, and cultural initiatives, of which each
executive selected two.
The individual, strategic, non-financial modifier has a total weighting of 10%, with maximum funding of
200% of the weighted amount, based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of the executive’s
performance and the impact on the organization of the executive’s achievement on the assigned goals.
For FY21, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the strategic goals for the CEO, and the
CEO approved the strategic goals for the other NEOs after consultation with the Compensation
Committee.
Additional detail, including the strategic non-financial goals for each NEO, can be found in the2022 Proxy
Statement (p. 39–40).
GOV.9 Materiality Assessment and Sustainability Strategy
We conduct periodic materiality assessments to identify and prioritize the topics on which we should focus
our strategies and reporting. Our approach considers issues that represent Jacobs’ significant
environmental, social, governance and economic impacts; our ability to drive long-term value creation and
what is important to internal and external stakeholders. The results of these assessments enable us to
continually upgrade our business for the future.
Materiality Assessment: 2018 and 2021
We conducted our first global materiality assessment in 2018, which served as a foundation for our
inaugural PlanBeyond sustainability strategy. We updated our materiality assessment in 2021, informed
by extensive research and engagement with a range of stakeholders about the sustainability risks,
opportunities and impacts most significant to our organization.
As part of this process, we identified a list of sustainability issues that are relevant to our industry, business
and impacts on people and planet and invited formal feedback on the significance and priority of these
topics. This included a global employee survey, to which we received 12,000 responses, representing 24%
of our total workforce. We also interviewed our company leaders and Board to understand their view on
Jacobs’ business risks, opportunities, impacts and emerging issues.
Additionally, we engaged key external stakeholders to understand their priorities and where they consider
Jacobs is best positioned to create positive impact. This outreach included interviews and dialogue with a
wide range of clients, suppliers, peers, investors, industry organizations and community partners across
geographies and sectors.
To inform our approach and validate priorities, we also incorporated global and industry trend analysis,
regulatory reviews, peer benchmarking, media scans and third-party expertise into the materiality
assessment process. Upon developing a prioritized list, we conducted feedback sessions with key internal
stakeholders and subject matter experts to review the findings and provide feedback into the next phase
of sustainability strategy development. Ultimately, this resulted in the launch of our sustainable business
approach,PlanBeyond 2.0, described below in further detail.
July 2022 Unaudited 56
FY21 ESG Disclosures
Materiality Assessment: 2022
We recognize the need to continually review and refine our materiality assessment and priorities—
particularly given the pace of change in our world due to the ongoing effects of COVID-19, global
reckoning on social justice, and other geopolitical and macroeconomic factors. Considering such external
conditions as well as internal developments, we refreshed our materiality assessment in 2022. Grounded
in the stakeholder feedback and results from our 2021 materiality assessment, we also considered recent
internal and external inputs and significant business advancements in our updated assessment, including
our FY22 to FY24company strategy, enterprise risk management framework, global Culture Survey (refer
to sectionSOC.3 Inclusion and Diversity - Strategy of this document) andClimate Action Plan.
This updated assessment resulted in the elevation of topics such as those related to climate response and
project impacts, innovation and digitization and human capital. As reflected in ourcompany strategy, the
climate crisis and other mega-trends present us with a unique opportunity to drive growth and long-term
value creation around climate response, secure data-driven solutions and consulting and advisory services.
It is through our broad range of client solutions that we will be able to not only deliver on this business
growth opportunity but amplify the scale of Jacobs’ positive impact on the environment and society.
As a professional services company, our people are the heart of our business. Attracting, engaging,
advancing and retaining top talent is foundational for us to deliver our company purpose to “create a more
connected, sustainable world.” Thus, issues related to human capital are high priorities, including health,
safety and wellbeing; inclusion and diversity; and talent attraction, development and retention.
Materiality Assessment: Priority Issues
The topics listed below reflect the results of our 2022 materiality assessment and the issues we continue
to prioritize in our business and sustainability strategies, decision making and reporting. While we have
listed these topics with an indication of priority from a global perspective, the relative importance may
shift based on local and operational context.

Sustainability Strategy
The outcomes from our stakeholder engagement, materiality assessment and feedback sessions
underpinned the development of ourPlanBeyond 2.0 sustainable business approach. Aligned with Jacobs’
purpose to create a more connected, sustainable world, PlanBeyond 2.0 represents the next phase of our
sustainability journey. It reflects a holistic approach to sustainability across the environmental, social and
economic dimensions and is being integrated into our business model and company strategy.
Compared to the original PlanBeyond framework launched in 2018, PlanBeyond 2.0 reflects two key
advancements: (1) amplifying our focus on integrating sustainability across 100% of our client solutions
and (2) more explicitly mapping our approach against the SDGs. We identified six SDGs that are material
to our business, where we can have the most influence and impact, in alignment with our 2022 materiality
assessment. While we remain committed to contributing towards all 17 SDGs, our core SDGs include:
 SDG 3: Good Health & Wellbeing
 SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
 SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
 SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
 SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
 SDG 13: Climate Action
In alignment with these core SDGs, we have developed six Sustainable Business Objectives (SBOs) that are
relevant to our business, summarized in Figure 3 below. Each SBO has a headline target and associated
sub-targets. The SBOs sit at the heart of our company strategy and define our aspirations around how we
can each play a part in creating a sustainable future for all. For more information on these SBO and our
strategies to deliver them, seePlanBeyond 2.0.
Figure 3. PlanBeyond 2.0 Sustainable Business Objectives
Table 36 summarizes the intersections among our 2022 materiality assessment, priority issues, strategies
and performance. Performance metrics are tracked regularly to measure our progress against our strategy
and long-term targets. The “Boundary” column refers to the scope of our involvement, influence and
impact in each area, both within and beyond our organization.

PlanBeyond™ is our sustainable business approach, developed based on our materiality assessment
(GOV.9 Materiality Assessment and Sustainability Strategy). There is a dedicated corporate sustainability
team leading on implementation of the focus areas and achievement of our sustainability goals, led by our
Global Head of Sustainability in our Office of Global Climate Response and ESG.
The PlanBeyond Executive Steering Committee is our executive-level body that meets five times a year to
agree on our strategy, review progress against commitments, update our plans around ESG risks and
opportunities, and provide review and oversight across our disclosures and reporting. The committee is
comprised of the Chair & CEO, CFO, COO, Chief Legal & Administrative Officer, Chief People Officer, Chief
Strategy & Communications Officer, Chief Digital & Information Officer, President and Senior Vice
Presidents of both LOBs, Senior Vice President Strategy & Solutions, Head of ERM, Head of Investor
Relations, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and Deputy General Counsel and Chief Compliance
Officer. Our President and CFO serves as the Executive Level Sponsor for Sustainability. Our SVP of Global
Climate Response and ESG is the most senior employee dedicated to ESG and Sustainability.
We have identified climate risks and opportunities as one of the company’s top ESG-related risks, and, as
such, the Board plays an active role in helping to ensure effective climate risk management. Board
oversight of ESG is spread across all Board Committees. The ESG & Risk Committee is responsible for the
reviewing and overseeing the Company’s overall ESG strategy, overseeing the Company’s key ESG
initiatives and policies and key enterprise-wide ESG metrics, targets, key performance indicators and
related goals. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of controls and processes over material
ESG data reporting and other ESG-related matters delegated from the ESG & Risk Committee. The Human
Resource and Compensation Committee is responsible for oversight of human capital management and
other ESG-related matters delegated from the ESG & Risk Committee. The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee is responsible for oversight of ESG-related matters delegated from the ESG & Risk
Committee.
Additionally, Jacobs has a cross-functional working group on ESG reporting, comprising functional leads
that are stakeholders in our carbon reporting and ESG disclosures. This committee includes leaders from
Finance, Legal, Internal Audit, and the Office of Global Climate Response & ESG. This group meets
monthly to discuss reporting updates,
regulatory changes, data quality and
external engagement. Figure 4.ESGGovernance Structure

GOV.11 Risk Governance
Our Executive Vice President (EVP), ERM is tasked with dedicated risk management responsibility,
reporting to our EVP and Chief Legal and Administrative Officer. Our President and COO is tasked with
responsibility for monitoring and auditing risk management performance on an operational level,
reporting to our Chair of the Board and CEO.
The Board oversees the Company’s approach to ERM, which is designed to support the achievement of
strategic objectives, improve organizational performance and enhance long-term shareholder value. In
conjunction with management, the Board assesses the specific risks faced by the Company and reviews the
steps taken by the Company’s leadership to manage those risks. The Board also provides guidance to and
oversight of management throughout the year with respect to setting the Company’s corporate strategy,
which facilitates these assessments and reviews. The Board also encourages management to promote a
corporate culture that integrates risk management into the Company’s corporate strategy and day-to-day
business operations in a way that is consistent with the Company’s targeted risk profile.
In FY21, the Board formed a new standing committee, the ESG & Risk Committee, to further enhance the
structure of the Board’s oversight for ESG and ERM. The ESG & Risk Committee assists the Board in overall
oversight of ESG and ERM matters, with certain specified areas being allocated to the Board’s other
standing committees. To ensure coordination and collaboration among the Board’s committees, the
membership of the ESG & Risk Committee includes members from each of the Board’s committees.
Additional discussion of the Board’s role in ERM oversight can be found in the2022 Proxy Statement,
including risk oversight for each committee, on pp. 14–16.
A Global Enterprise Risk Steering Committee, chaired by our EVP for ERM, oversees and works with teams
working on priority areas (for example, ESG, Cyber and Projects) and defines and updates as necessary,
risk appetite and risk policies. Key ESG risk and opportunity areas include, but are not limited to, climate,
supply chain, inclusion and diversity, health and safety, and talent attraction, retention and development.
OurFY21 Form 10-K contains a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that could have a
material adverse effect on the Company (pp. 21–46).
As detailed further in the Climate Change section of this document (ENV.15 Climate Change), our first
global climate risk assessment was completed in March 2020. We applied the TCFD framework to identify
climate risks that are material to our business, including those arising from both physical and transitional
risks. Potential risks include project failure, operational and supply chain disruption, being outpaced by
competitors, and business fragmentation. Our opportunity analysis indicates that we are well-placed to
take advantage of low and zero carbon transition and help our clients create smart, resilient cities and
infrastructure.
Our Global Security & Resilience (GS&R) program provides integrated assurance from its subject matter
experts to identify, react and adapt to disruption. It sets the standards and framework to ensure
designation, responsibility, competence and tools for anticipation, evaluation, preparation, response, and
management of emergency incidents and crisis events, based on the Incident Command System, a
standard emergency response model used internationally. Our business resilience program safeguards the
protection of our people, environment, assets, and reputation, as well as enabling the continuation of
business services to endure and succeed.
Emerging Risks
Two emerging risks that may have long-term impact on the business are summarized in Table 37. Both
risks are included in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework and are the subject of regular
review and discussion in Jacobs’ risk governance processes, including Board oversight and engagement.

To validate the effectiveness of our systems at least annually we conduct tests of our business continuity,
contingency plans and incident response procedures. We also conduct third-party vulnerability analysis
including simulated hacker attacks and conduct our own monthly vulnerability assessments.
All employees are required to take annual cybersecurity awareness training. New hires are also required to
take cybersecurity awareness training during onboarding. Quarterly phishing campaigns are also
conducted with remedial training required for failures to recognize phishing. Policies require all employees
to notify Cybersecurity of any suspicious items. We do not release training results or related information
on our employees due to the sensitivity and proprietary nature of the information.
As part of our cybersecurity governance, we utilize a Cybersecurity Steering Committee comprising
executive management, operational leaders and cross-functional teams. Generally, this committee meets
quarterly, or as frequently as appropriate, to review, assess and direct decision related to cybersecurity and
information systems matters.
The Board recognizes the importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers,
contractors, partners, and employees. As a part of its objective, independent oversight of the key risks
facing the Company, the Board devotes significant time and attention to data and systems protection,
including cybersecurity and information security risk. Additional information on the Board’s role in
