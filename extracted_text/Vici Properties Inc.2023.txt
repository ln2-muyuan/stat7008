VICI AND HIGHLIGHTS

Introduction to VICI
Formed in October 2017, VICI began with a portfolio of 18 leading gaming assets across the United States leased to and operated by
Caesars Entertainment. Since then, we have grown to become an S&P 500 ® company and the owner of one of the largest portfolios of
market-leading gaming, hospitality, and entertainment destinations. Our geographically diverse portfolio of 93 experiential assets

approximately 127 million square feet and features approximately 60,300 hotel rooms and over 500 restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and
sportsbooks. We also have a growing array of real estate and financing partnerships with leading operators in other experiential
sectors, including Bowlero, Cabot, Canyon Ranch, Chelsea Piers, Great Wolf Resorts, Homefield, and Kalahari Resorts, and own four
externally managed championship golf courses in Nevada, Indiana, and Mississippi.

Message from the CEO
Dear VICI Stakeholders,
We are proud to present you with VICI’s fourth annual ESG report. At VICI, we believe that our success can be attributed to
our focus on making sure that as we grow our portfolio, we take every opportunity to also improve as a company. Over the
past 6 years, we have grown to now own 93 experiential properties in the U.S. and Canada operated by 13 tenants,
increased our dividend at a 7.9% CAGR since our first quarter post-IPO, achieved investment grade credit rating and S&P
500® inclusion, all while continuing to improve our focus and approach to ESG. Among other highlights this year, we
increased the scope and quality of asset-level data received through our tenant outreach efforts, implemented new
sustainable policies at our new corporate headquarters, pursued significant resource-conserving capital improvement
projects at our golf courses, expanded our corporate giving and citizenship efforts led by our VICI Volunteers group, and
maintained our stockholder-friendly corporate governance practices.
As part of our ongoing effort to get better as we grow, the entire VICI team engaged in defining the below five pillars that
encompass our values as an organization. The full set of VICI Values is presented later in this report, but what I want to
emphasize here is that not only do these values underpin our success from an earnings growth perspective, they also inform
our approach to ESG:
1. LEAD WITH GOOD INTENTIONS
At VICI, relationships are at the heart of what defines our business success. We lead with positivity and a partnership
mentality in seeking creative solutions that mutually benefit us and our partners and provide returns for our stockholders.
Our business and our portfolio benefit from well-intentioned, environmentally and socially responsible partners to build
and sustain a best-in-class real estate portfolio.
2. ENGAGE WITH RIGOR
Due to our relatively small tenant base when compared to triple-net peers, we are able to maintain meaningful dialogues
with each of our partners. Quality of tenant engagement is one of VICI’s unique strengths and facilitates our engagement
on environmental sustainability and social responsibility issues.
3. CARRY THE BATON
While the majority of our portfolio’s ESG impact is under the purview of our tenants, we continue to expand our social
responsibility efforts with the growth of our organization and remain focused on improving our environmental
performance at our externally managed golf courses, as well as our corporate headquarters located in a LEED Gold
certified building in New York City. We lead by example where we can with sustainability initiatives at our corporate
headquarters and externally managed golf courses.
4. BRING A FIFTH CHAIR
Our VICI team is small but mighty (with 29 full-time staff), and as we continue to grow our headcount, we seek to provide
opportunities to our employees to grow their responsibilities and develop their strengths, while also recognizing the value
of third-party support and force multiplication. Being inclusive and open to differing viewpoints is vital to pursuing
meaningful improvement in our organization on all fronts.
5. CULTIVATE RELATIONSHIPS TO WIN THE TIES
In light of our triple-net lease model, constructing our tenant roster is one of the most important things we do, and we have
continued to approach each of our partnerships with quality as a top-of-mind outcome. Building and maintaining strong
and constructive relationships with our partners is essential to our progress on ESG initiatives.
Within this report, we have highlighted our recent progress and continuing efforts within each of these pillars. We hope you
will find this report useful and encourage you to reach out to us at ESG@viciproperties.com with any questions or thoughts
you may have.

Introduction to the Triple-Net Lease Model
Within our real estate investment trust (“REIT”) structure, our leased properties are subject to long-term triple-net leases, which
generally provide that our tenants retain exclusive operational control of the properties and are solely responsible for management
and operation of the property and all related expenses, including taxes, insurance, operating expenses such as maintenance, repair,
and capital improvement, and utilities.
While the terms of our triple-net leases include conditions and requirements relating to, among other things, operating condition and
maintenance, capital expenditures, and reporting, our tenants generally have autonomy in operating their businesses and managing
the properties, including with respect to their implementation of any ESG initiatives. As a result, our tenants make independent decisions
regarding their business strategy and operations, including whether and how to pursue ESG initiatives at our leased properties.

Impact of the Gaming Regulatory Environment
Due to the highly regulated nature of the gaming and racing industries, the ownership of our gaming and racing assets is subject to
applicable gaming and racing licenses, state and local gaming and racing laws, and gaming and racing regulatory oversight,
which generally qualifies us as an owner and supplier of real estate (in contrast to the licensure status of our tenants as gaming and
racing operators). As a real estate owner and landlord, these regulations strictly limit our ability to participate in any operational decisions.
Accordingly, the implementation of operational measures at our leased properties is beyond the scope of our role and authority.
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF GAMING
According to the American Gaming Association (AGA), the
gaming industry has an expansive impact on the U.S. economy,

internal and external VICI stakeholders, including our executive officers, members of our Management Committee (as described on
page 18), our Board of Directors, as well as our tenants, significant stockholders, and business partners. The following materiality matrix
presents the results of the survey and additional analysis in measuring the ESG topics of highest importance to these stakeholders, as

Our Approach to the UN Sustainable Development Goals
Our 2022-2023 ESG Report included an initial identification of which UN SDGs were most relevant
to our business and offered opportunity for the greatest potential impact following the completion
of our inaugural stakeholder materiality assessment in 2023. Since then, our ESG Committee has
continued to review and refine our ESG strategy and alignment with the UN SDGs, the results of
which are presented below. We expect to continue to refresh this analysis from time to time with the
growth of our business, overall ESG program, and future stakeholder feedback.

Tenant Engagement Philosophy and Touchpoints
As a passive real estate owner, our tenants at our leased properties independently operate their businesses and serve as long-term
stewards of our real estate assets. We believe we have established positive relationships with each of our tenants that empower them
to independently operate and grow their businesses, while maintaining ongoing communication and open dialogue regarding our
leased properties, areas of shared interest, and the potential for mutually beneficial opportunities that allow for shared growth and
success. Our engagement with our tenants and feedback obtained from them through a broad range of contact points allows us to
maintain these positive relationships and monitor our tenants and the performance and condition of our assets.

Key Corporate Policies
Our corporate policies establish our expectations and requirements with respect to key areas of our operations, as well as the
conduct of our executives, employees, and directors. These policies are reviewed periodically under the purview of our Board and its
respective committees to address key changes in our business, emerging best practices, new legal and regulatory requirements,
and other developments.
Our Code of Business Conduct establishes our commitment to business ethics and integrity, our overarching policy to
conduct our business activities with the highest level of integrity and ethical standards, and our expectation that our
officers, employees, and directors adhere to high ethical standards in their conduct, as well as strict compliance and
reporting requirements. The Code of Business Conduct covers key topics such as conflicts of interest, competition and fair
dealing, business entertainment and gifts, and compliance with applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption, anti-money
laundering, and economic sanctions laws.
Our approach to Corporate Responsibility is predicated on our core commitment to sustainable business practices
that encourage a culture of economic, environmental, and social responsibility through our business activities
regardless of geographic location, within the scope of our capabilities, and consistent with applicable laws and
regulations, and our Code of Business Conduct and other policies. These commitments address topics such as:
— Environmental Sustainability — Education and Training Opportunities
— Biodiversity — Employee Engagement and Satisfaction
— Climate Strategy, Governance, and Risk Management — Health, Safety, and Wellness
— Green Building Certifications — Human Rights and Labor
— Corporate Giving and Community Impact — Cybersecurity and Data Protection
— Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion — Supplier Engagement
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth a flexible framework within which the Board of Directors, assisted by its
committees, directs the affairs of the Company. The Guidelines reflect the Board of Directors’ commitment to monitoring
the effectiveness of decision-making at the Board of Directors- and management-level and ensuring adherence to good
corporate governance principles.
Our Responsible Supplier Principles outline our expectations for the responsible business practices of our third-party
suppliers, including our expectation that our third-party suppliers comply with all applicable laws and regulations; have
a commitment to a diverse workplace; institute and enforce policies prohibiting harassment and discrimination; prohibit
forced labor, abuse of labor (including human trafficking), and child labor; comply with all applicable local and national
wage, work hours, overtime, and benefits laws; and support environmental sustainability and business integrity.
Our Political Contribution Policy requires that the utilization of company resources for political advocacy purposes
must be in compliance with applicable law and subject to the approval of the Board of Directors. VICI has not expended
corporate resources for political advocacy purposes, including in support of any political candidate, party, or political
action committee. Certain trade and industry groups of which we are a member, including Nareit and the AGA, may
utilize a portion of our membership fees for lobbying and political activities which are allocated by the respective
organizations and not directed by VICI. Our general membership objectives are to support the key sectors in which we
operate, specifically real estate investment trusts and the American gaming industry, including advocacy on behalf of
members. We also encourage our employees to participate in political activities on their own time and at their own
expense, in a manner consistent with applicable law and policies.
Our Whistleblower Policy provides for a confidential and secure online
and telephonic whistleblower reporting structure for the anonymous ZERO
submission of complaints, including submissions unrelated to Material Whistleblower Submissions

Management also performs additional risk evaluations and reports to the Audit Committee and the Board on a regular basis regarding
risks associated with areas such as our long-term strategy, overall compliance with applicable gaming regulatory requirements and
licensure, financial covenants and reporting, listing exchange rules, and other obligations, cybersecurity and information technology,
developing corporate governance topics, and our executive compensation practices.
Enterprise Risk Management Process
Our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework is premised on actively monitoring the Company’s risk profile; ensuring the
involvement of management, the Board of Directors, and key employees in evaluating and addressing risk; and maintaining effective
policies, controls, and procedures to manage risk and pursue our strategic priorities.
MANAGEMENT ROLE
01
Management is responsible for our risk management policies and practices and monitors risks identified under the
ERM framework and new and emerging risks throughout the year in the course of operating our business. As
appropriate, management provides detailed briefings to the Board of Directors and appropriate committees with
respect to assessments, procedures, and controls completed or implemented in response to new and emerging risks.
QUARTERLY REFRESH
02
On a quarterly basis, management and key employees reevaluate their risk assessment from the most recent
Enterprise Risk Assessment ("ERA"), including with respect to key risk drivers, mitigants and trends, and emerging risks.
ANNUAL ASSESSMENT
03
On an annual basis, management (with the input of directors and external advisors) refreshes the ERA to reevaluate
the spectrum of potential risks under our ERM framework and incorporate new and emerging identified risks.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEE REVIEW
04
The results of the annual ERA are presented for review and further discussion among the executive leadership team, key
employees, and members of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. Each quarter, the executive leadership
team reports to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors to review and discuss trends in the risk assessment.
Additional information on our risk management practices, including our ERM framework and our cybersecurity and IT policies and
procedures, is available in our 2024 Proxy Statement. Information regarding the responsibilities of our Board of Directors and its
committees is available in our 2024 Proxy Statement and each committee charter, which are available on our website.

Corporate Headquarters
Our corporate headquarters in New York City is located in an Energy Star-certified and LEED-EB
Gold-certified building through the integration of many of the latest sustainable building materials
and systems into the building’s operations. In May 2024, we transitioned to new office space within
our existing building pursuant to an amended lease, which incorporated certain green lease

ESG Due Diligence
Within our broader underwriting and due diligence strategy, our ESG-related evaluations are two-fold. Our transactional due diligence
serves as a starting point for our subsequent tenant engagement programs, including establishing a dialogue with key counterparts to
learn about their ESG strategies and priorities, collaborating with respect to collecting and reporting sustainability data, and
evaluating the sustainability, environmental impact, and climate risk readiness of the properties.

Environmental Management System
In 2024, with the assistance of our strategic ESG consultant, we are developing an internal EMS based on the ISO 14001 framework,
which governs our approach to addressing the environmental performance of our operational portfolio and to environmental
management of properties outside of our operational control given our triple net-lease structure. The EMS outlines how we aim to
identify, document, monitor, evaluate, provide resources for, and communicate our environmental initiatives by focusing on meeting
the environmental commitments we make in our corporate policies. We expect to utilize this framework to further progress our
internal environmental sustainability projects and engagement with our key partners, including CDN Golf and our tenants and
borrowers.

Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program for Golf
We are proud to acknowledge two of our golf courses as certified members of the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program for
Golf, with Chariot Run Golf Club certified since 2009 and Grand Bear Golf Club achieving the first level of certification with
respect to environmental planning in early 2023. CDN Golf and management at each of our golf courses continue to work with
the Audubon Society on the multi-year planning and certification process.
The Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program for Golf, sponsored by the Audubon Society, is an education and certification
program that helps golf courses protect the environment, preserve the natural heritage of the game of golf, promote
environmental sustainability, and gain recognition for the efforts of golf course operators. The program serves an important
environmental role by helping enhance the valuable natural areas and wildlife habitats that golf courses provide, improve
efficiency, and minimize potentially harmful impacts of golf course operation by assisting members in planning on six key
environmental components: site assessment / environmental planning, wildlife and habitat management, chemical use
reduction and safety, water conservation, water quality management, and outreach and education.
The Cabot Collection and Audubon International
Sustainability Partnership
In June 2024, Audubon International and The Cabot Collection announced a groundbreaking sustainability partnership, with
Cabot becoming the first multi-property brand to enroll every one of its owned golf courses and surrounding built
environment into Audubon International’s comprehensive, all-inclusive Platinum Signature Sanctuary certification program.
We are thrilled at Cabot’s continuing commitment to sustainability as demonstrated by this partnership and the continued
management of our golf courses by their affiliate, CDN Golf.

Operational Portfolio Sustainability Data
The following data represents water, electricity, fuel, and combined energy consumption, as well as estimated Scope 1, Scope 2,
and combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in our operational portfolio, comprised of our corporate headquarters and
four golf courses.
We utilize a third-party sustainability monitoring platform to track utility usage, evaluate trends, and report available data with
respect to our operational portfolio. Our estimated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data is generated through our third-party
sustainability monitoring platform, through which we monitor and track our overall utility usage at our corporate headquarters
and golf courses.
Our ability to track and report waste and waste diversion data is limited in some cases by the available utilities and services at our
corporate headquarters and our golf courses, including the communities in which they are located. Specifically, we do not provide
for waste disposal or recycling tracking on a tonnage basis at a significant portion of our operational portfolio.

Addressing Climate Change
As a real estate owner and investor, we recognize that the impact of increasing natural hazards and global climate trends,
chronic trends, and acute events may pose a risk to VICI’s business model and performance. While we operate under a triple-net
lease model, and the operation, maintenance, repair, and improvements of our leased properties are the responsibility of our
tenants, the ongoing efforts described below allow us to better understand the risks and opportunities posed by climate change,
enhance our climate-related governance and risk management processes, and engage with our tenants regarding their climate
change risk evaluation and mitigation efforts. In the Appendix beginning on page 53, we provide an index in alignment with the
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Guidelines.

Climate Goals, Metrics, and Targets
We understand the importance of, and seek to provide for, the long-term sustainability and resilience of our real estate portfolio
against the impact of climate change. We independently evaluate asset-level climate risk in the course of our transactional due
diligence (refer to page 33 for additional information) and offer to share these findings with our tenants, with our most recent
portfolio-wide climate risk assessment completed in 2022. Our key performance metric to date is the percentage of our portfolio for
which we are able to assess climate change risk and obtain property-level sustainability and utility usage information. We continue to
evaluate the monitoring and reporting of additional key performance indicators, such as climate and sustainability-focused capital
expenditures by our tenants in maintaining and improving our leased properties, as well as total capital we provide to our tenants
through our potential role as a financing source for climate and sustainability-oriented capital improvement projects (to the extent our
tenants elect to utilize such opportunities).
PROPERTY-LEVEL MITIGATION MEASURES
OPERATIONAL PORTFOLIO Our climate risk mitigation efforts at our corporate headquarters and golf courses are
described earlier in this ESG Report. In partnership with CDN Golf, we seek to implement
climate risk mitigation measures at our golf courses to limit the potential impact of physical
and transition-related climate risk. With respect to Cascata Golf Club and Rio Secco Golf
Club in Nevada, CDN Golf continues to address responsive efforts into its operations and
capital expenditure plans to address new state and local water use regulations following a
third-party regulatory analysis completed in 2023 to assess the compliance requirements
and expected impact on operations.
TRIPLE-NET PORTFOLIO Due to our triple-net lease model and our tenants’ exclusive operational control of our leased
assets, we are limited in our ability to directly implement climate risk mitigation measures at
our leased properties. Subject to the terms of our leases, we rely on our tenants to maintain
our leased properties in the course of their operations. Our tenants manage such risk in the
course of operating their business and many have implemented various property-level risk
mitigation measures (refer to page 45 for additional information).
GHG EMISSIONS / REDUCTION TARGETS
OPERATIONAL PORTFOLIO With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, we report estimated Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG
emissions based on available utility data as provided by a leading third-party sustainability
platform. As we continue to progress our climate risk mitigation efforts, we expect to perform a
full GHG emissions inventory pursuant to the GHG Protocol in accordance with any applicable
disclosure or reporting requirements (including the pending climate change disclosure rule
published by the SEC in April 2024). In connection with our energy and emissions reduction
initiatives, we continue to assess the feasibility of establishing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG
emissions reduction targets with respect to our operational portfolio (comprised of our
headquarters and golf courses).
TRIPLE-NET PORTFOLIO Given our current portfolio and triple-net lease model, a large majority of our total GHG
emissions are classified as Scope 3 emissions (for which available data is presented under
“Triple-Net Portfolio Sustainability Dashboard” starting on page 44). We are generally reliant
on our tenants to track and report such data and continue to work with our tenants to obtain
available data regarding the direct emissions performance of our triple-net leased properties
to the extent possible. As our tenants maintain exclusive control of their operations at our
leased properties, we ultimately do not control GHG emissions at these properties and
therefore have determined not to establish Scope 3 GHG emissions reduction targets.

ESG Tenant Engagement Programs
As set forth in the “Tenant Engagement Philosophy and Touchpoints” on page 15, a key component of our engagement efforts
relates to understanding their independent ESG goals, strategy, and current priorities. As our tenants retain exclusive operational
control of the properties through the life of the leases, our recognition and encouragement of their independent sustainability
efforts by identifying creative and mutually beneficial program opportunities is an essential path toward continuing to improve
the sustainability performance and profile of our leased property portfolio.

Financing Capital Expenditure and Capital Improvement Projects
We continue to evaluate potential efforts through which we seek to recognize and encourage our tenants’ implementation of
sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change mitigation measures at our leased properties, including the incentivization of
sustainability-related capital expenditure projects pursuant to the terms of our triple-net leases. In addition, certain of our triple-net
leases generally provide for our right to finance larger scale capital improvement or capital expenditure projects. We are seeking to
encourage and potentially finance sustainability-oriented capital improvement projects initiated by our tenants through our Partner
Property Growth Fund (to the extent our tenants elect to utilize such financing), including through the evaluation of long-term impact to
a given property’s operating efficiency or climate risk resiliency.

Under our triple-net leases, the realization of climate-related risks and opportunities at
our leased properties, such as damages from climate change or decreased operating
costs as a result of energy efficiency improvements, primarily impact the business,
strategy, and financial performance of our tenants and do not affect their rent and
other obligations under our leases.
Our tenants are responsible for obtaining and maintaining adequate insurance
coverage with respect to our leased properties, including climate-related risk
exposure, consistent with the particular provisions of each lease. In the event of a
Impact on business casualty or condemnation, our tenants are generally responsible for addressing any Climate Change
strategy and planning covered losses, as well as restoring the property to its previous condition. As a result of Strategy (40)
this triple-net structure, our tenants are responsible for the management of
immediate climate-related risk and would be expected to bear the costs of both
short- and long-term climate-related impacts through the applicable lease term.
Climate-related risks and opportunities impact us in limited circumstances, including
when climate considerations impact our ability to lease properties (including
negatively impacting the asset value and viability of our tenants’ operations at such
properties) or if a property were to incur damages that limit our tenants’ operations or
diminish the asset value.

In connection with potential acquisitions, we perform customary environmental due
diligence, including climate change risk assessments, to identify and address any
underlying risks and liabilities and inform our investment decision. We have also
performed climate change risk assessments with respect to our golf courses and our
leased property portfolio, most recently in 2022, to provide us with a better

leased properties, including the implementation of climate risk mitigation measures.
Accordingly, our risk assessments also provided insight into available strategies, which
we offer to share with our tenants, in order to take steps to mitigate identified risks.
Pursuant to the terms of our triple-net leases, we monitor material developments at our
leased properties, including those relating to the potential impact of climate change.
Our property-level environmental assessment reports allowed us in certain
circumstances to evaluate current and future climate risks, along with current

We track certain sustainability data relating to our owned and operated golf courses
based on available sources, including water, electricity, and fuel. With respect to our
triple-net leased portfolio, we conduct customary environmental due diligence,
including obtaining climate risk reports, in connection with our transactional due Climate Goals,
Metrics used to assess
diligence. Following an acquisition, we are largely reliant on our tenants to provide Metrics, and
climate-related risks
updated information regarding their climate-related risk evaluations and the Targets (42)
implementation of climate mitigation measures. Due to our triple-net model, we cannot
make alterations or improvements to our triple-net leased properties to mitigate and
manage climate-related risk.

Scope 3: As a triple-net lessor, we understand from an initial evaluation that substantially Energy and
Scope 1 and 2 all of our overall Scope 3 emissions come from our tenants’ independent operation of our Emissions (37),
emissions leased assets. We have reported our available Scope 3 emissions data comprising Operational Portfolio
certain of our leased properties’ reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as provided by Sustainability Data (39)
our tenants and intend to expand upon our efforts in the future to better estimate our
Scope 3 emissions and to enhance our data reporting capabilities. Following the
effectiveness of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s climate-related disclosure
rule published in April 2024, we expect to implement processes and additional
disclosures to ensure compliance with the rule requirements.
In connection with our energy and emissions reduction initiatives, we continue to
assess the feasibility of establishing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions reduction
targets with respect to our operational portfolio (comprised of our headquarters and
golf courses).
With respect to our triple-net lease portfolio, due to the triple-net lease model and the
highly regulated nature of the gaming industry, we are unable to make alterations or
improvements to our properties to mitigate and manage physical and transitional risk
as a result of climate change. Notwithstanding this, we have independently performed Climate Goals, Metrics,

climate risk assessments (in connection with transactional due diligence and our and Targets (42)
portfolio-level climate risk assessment performed in 2022) and have offered to provide
our tenants with findings from our risk reports to enable them to make well-advised
decisions with respect to climate change risk in the course of operating our leased
properties pursuant to our leases. Given our lack of operational control of our leased
property portfolio and inability to implement, monitor, and track sustainability efforts
directly, we ultimately do not control GHG emissions at these properties and therefore
have determined not to establish Scope 3 emissions reduction targets.
