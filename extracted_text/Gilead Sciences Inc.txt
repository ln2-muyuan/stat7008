To All Stakeholders:
Thank you for your interest in Gilead and our Environmental, Social and
Governance (ESG) commitments. Here at Gilead, we live by these commitments
every day in service of our vision: to make the world a healthier place for
all people.
Just as Gilead is known for its scientific leadership, we are equally focused
on our sense of responsibility to our society and future generations. That
responsibility includes a strong emphasis on access and health equity. Gilead’s
unique approach to ESG has been widely recognized by organizations such
as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and CNBC’s JUST Capital.
In this year’s report, you will see examples of our impact across four pillars:
• Innovating Scientific Solutions
• Advancing Health Equity and Access

ESG AT GILEAD
MARKET ACCESS
Since our earliest days as a small biotech startup, Gilead has partnered with
patient communities and other stakeholders to develop groundbreaking
therapies specifically for underserved populations. ESG runs throughout our
entire value chain and is a practice Gilead has been doing for more than
three and a half decades.
For Gilead, ESG is not a nice-to-have but instead something that is embedded
into our value chain and core business operations. We have taken a thoughtful
and deliberate approach to ensure that our decisions lead with corporate
responsibility and sustainability principles. APPROVAL
ESG at Gilead is about centering the work all 18,000 employees do, from
the lab all the way to people and communities, into four key pillars:
MANUFACTURING
•
Scientific Innovation
•
Health Equity and Access
•
People
•
Sustainability
Every node on our value chain has a part to play in upholding these four
pillars and, by integrating these commitments into business practices,
we ensure that every employee is living our values.

Nowhere is the “S” in ESG more central to our work than in developing
medicines that change lives. But the conditions our therapies prevent, treat
and cure don’t live in the lab – they impact real people living in diverse
communities around the globe. The most innovative science only makes a
difference if it can be effectively used by the individuals who need it. That’s
why we look well beyond just the efficacy of our medicines. We’re also
keenly focused on pioneering dosage regimens and delivery methods that
can help break down the barriers that make it hard for people to adhere
to their prescribed treatment.
We are, and always have been, a mission-focused, patient-centered company.
The needs and realities of patients, their families and their communities power

CURING HEPATITIS C Bruce Kreter
Global HCV Medical Affairs
A decade ago, individuals living with hepatitis C (HCV) had limited treatment
options, often with harsh side effects that required at least 48 weeks of
treatment. In late 2013, Gilead received FDA approval for its first curative
therapy for HCV. With this groundbreaking treatment, many people living with
HCV could be cured, often in as little as eight to 12 weeks. In transforming
HCV treatment, Gilead transformed millions of lives.
Our curative therapies have been approved for children, adults, people
who live with liver disease or have been previously treated with other
HCV treatments. We also have a treatment that can cure all six genotypes
of HCV, which simplifies treatment protocols, particularly in settings with
limited resources.
In the 10 years since that first approval, more than 5 million people worldwide
have been treated with one of Gilead’s HCV medicines, which are now
approved in more than 100 countries. Today, 95% or more of people treated
for HCV are cured. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
more than 10 million people worldwide have been cured of HCV by Gilead
medicines and those that followed.
Gilead is an active partner in pursuing the WHO goal of eliminating HCV
by 2030. With an estimated 50 million people globally still living with HCV, Setting Our Sights on Eliminating

to achieve their best health underpins our emphasis on the social aspects
of ESG. While our medicines already touch more than 30 million lives, we
know millions more face systemic barriers that prevent them from accessing

need such treatment.
Our health equity efforts enable us to reach more people with innovative
therapies, especially those in underresourced and disinvested communities
where individuals are disproportionately impacted by the medical conditions
that we seek to prevent, treat and cure.
We have identified three global health equity priorities that will help us
achieve our mission of creating a healthier world for all people:
• Helping to enable access to life-changing medicines
• Delivering scientific innovation to reduce inequities

FOCUS ON BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA
In 2016, Baton Rouge faced a crisis. The city had long been an
epicenter of the HIV epidemic, with the highest rate of late-stage
HIV diagnoses in the United States. Just seven years later, the
rate of late-stage HIV diagnoses has fallen precipitously – to less
than the national average.
FOCUS partnered with local hospitals, urgent care centers and
syringe service programs to address stigma and other barriers,
and meeting people wherever they enter the healthcare system.
Tackling the issue of testing and treatment – and applying these
solutions at scale – had a profound impact on Black residents in
Louisiana who were disproportionately represented within the
local population living with HIV.
This model has since been rolled out to all city hospitals, and in
the years since the program launched, the rate of late-stage HIV
diagnoses in Baton Rouge fell to less than the national average
(18.7% versus 21.1%).

Reunion Project HIV AGE POSITIVELY®
HIV Age Positively grantee
(Photo courtesy of Reunion Project) For the first time in history, nearly 50% of people in the U.S. who are living with
HIV are over the age of 50. By 2030, in the U.S., it is expected this figure will
reach 70%. This is in sharp contrast to the early days of the epidemic when
there was little hope for people diagnosed with HIV. Today, this longevity for
PLWH is an inspiring and powerful reminder of the heroic efforts of all that
have made these advancements possible.
Despite this progress, Gilead recognizes that more important work needs to
be done. For example, by 2030, more than 80% of people living with HIV will
have at least one age-related medical condition, such as cancer or heart
disease — an underexamined, underappreciated and underfunded public
health issue demanding urgent attention.
This challenge led us to create Gilead’s HIV Age Positively® initiative, which
supports programs focused on improving the quality of life and health for
those who are aging and living with HIV. Since inception, we’ve provided
almost $36 million in grant funding to 42 organizations that work to ensure
people aging with HIV receive care tailored to their needs through continuing
education and training programs for doctors and nurses, colocation of medical
services, innovative models of care and other strategies.

HELPING ENSURE ACCESS TO GENUINE MEDICINES Legal
The proliferation of counterfeit medicines puts the health and safety of people who depend on life-
changing treatments at grave risk. Even with dedicated resources and commitments by industry and law
enforcement to keep people safe from counterfeits, criminals exploit vulnerabilities in current supply
chain regulations.
To help ensure that individuals worldwide can access the authentic Gilead medicines they have been
prescribed, Gilead maintains a Global Product Security group that leads an inclusive, cross-functional
Anti-Counterfeiting Task Force (ACT) consisting of legal, quality, regulatory, trades, global serialization
and traceability, security, supply chain, packaging and other Gilead professionals.
Gilead’s work to ensure safe, unaltered medicines for patients involves working with law enforcement
globally and taking swift and direct legal action to protect patients when needed. Gilead’s efforts
to monitor, detect and investigate illegal activity threatening patient safety can end in raids of illegal
counterfeiting operations. These activities were featured by CNBC in 2023, raising awareness for
vulnerable individuals. From 2021 to 2023, Gilead removed more than 4,500 bottles of counterfeit
versions of Gilead medicines from the legitimate supply chain and supported law enforcement efforts
to seize hundreds of thousands of units of counterfeits and other illicit medicines, helping ensure patients
receive the medicines they are prescribed.
Gilead employs several strategies to help disrupt these illicit counterfeiting and fraud schemes that
go beyond legal and regulatory requirements to make the world a safer place for patients, including:
• Education and Awareness • Detection
• Prevention and Advocacy • Investigation and Response

Despite CAR T-cell therapies being available for more than five years,

receiving it in the U.S. We are working to bring CAR T closer to where

patients live and engaging country health officials, hospitals and patient

communities affected by high cancer rates. There is a fundamental lack of
awareness of CAR T-cell therapy among patients and caregivers, and many
learn about CAR T after multiple relapses when time is of the essence, and
urgency is high.
To deliver CAR T to patients more efficiently, we need to overcome the

PUTTING AN END TO HIV AROUND THE WORLD
Since the emergence of HIV as a deadly public health crisis in the 1980s,
Gilead has played an integral role in mitigating its impact on people and
communities around the world through significant investments in R&D,
global partnerships and improved access to care.
These efforts have given rise to breakthrough therapies and important
outreach programs that have helped transform lives and inspired the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s ambition to eliminate
HIV by 2030.
However, there is still much more work to do to fully achieve this goal.
The WHO estimates that approximately 39 million people still live with
the disease, and our experience has shown that even when treatments
exist, they may not reach people most in need. This is especially true in
underserved areas of the world, where lack of awareness and infrastructure
compound the nearly universal social stigma associated with this disease.
As we continue to develop HIV treatments to support all individual needs,
we remain steadfast in our focus to also address the social realities
impeding health prosperity for all.

MARKING FIVE YEARS OF SERVING UNMET HIV NEEDS
IN THE U.S. SOUTH: COMPASS INITIATIVE®
The social disparities influencing health outcomes are particularly acute
in the Southern U.S., where poverty, lower rates of insurance and lack of
clinical care can impede access to HIV therapies. In 2021, 52% of all new
HIV diagnoses in the United States came from this region, with the states
of Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi all designated priority regions by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
In 2023, Gilead celebrated the five-year anniversary of its COMPASS Initiative®,
a more than $100 million commitment over 10 years to address HIV in the U.S.
South. Since its inception, Gilead’s COMPASS Initiative has provided more
than $106 million for on-the-ground education, training and care. COMPASS
also creates collaborative partnerships to share knowledge on increasing
organizational capacity, building awareness and reducing HIV-related stigma,
including through faith-based outreach efforts.
COMPASS IMPACT TO DATE
• $106M in grants
• 400 community-based organizations supported
• 208K+ individuals served with capacity-building training

Anthony Johnson and Dr. James Makokis PARTNERING WITH INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES
Gilead Health Equity Summit, Canada
TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES
In 2023, Gilead issued its largest-ever commitment to addressing the social barriers contributing to the
transmission of HIV and viral hepatitis in Australia’s and Canada’s Indigenous communities. The three
year, $6 million grant, divided equally between the two countries, supports front-line organizations and
initiatives that address culturally appropriate solutions for improving the health of their communities.
By listening to and working with Indigenous-led organizations, Gilead believes this commitment can
translate to meaningful support of innovative and culturally appropriate projects that address the
disproportionate rate of HIV and viral hepatitis in Indigenous communities.
In recent years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males in Australia have been diagnosed with HIV at
a rate of almost three times that of their non-Indigenous peers. Complicating matters is the stigma around
HIV and the community’s historical mistrust of healthcare professionals.
In Canada, Indigenous Peoples continue to experience a significantly higher incidence of HIV and viral
hepatitis compared to non-Indigenous populations. While Indigenous Peoples represent just 5% of
Canada’s total population, they make up 18.2% of all new HIV infections and are two to five times more
likely to contract hepatitis C than non-Indigenous groups.
Gilead’s funding commitment underscores the company’s unique efforts to increase health equity and
help end the HIV epidemic globally through robust community partnerships and philanthropy.

BREAKING THE CHILDHOOD HIV CYCLE mothers2mothers

IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

HIV affects 1.7 million children around world, with 85% of diagnoses
occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. While access to care is challenging for
many individuals living with HIV, it’s especially problematic for children,
whose treatment options have traditionally lagged those for adults.
In many parts of the world, liquid medications and reduced-dosage options
are unavailable, requiring children to take multiple pills each day to avoid a
virus resurgence. This, along with the bitter taste of medication, can compound
the challenge of therapeutic adherence, which is vital for viral suppression.
In 2023, Gilead initiated collaborations with the Clinton Health Access
Initiative, Penta ID Network and Eurofins’ Monell Chemical Senses
Center to accelerate the development and adoption of advanced (and
better tasting) HIV treatments to all children living with HIV. Working
together, we aim to break the cycle of pediatric HIV and bring the world
closer to ending the epidemic for everyone.
1.7M children
under the age of
15 live with HIV. However, just over 50%
of them are on antiretroviral treatment
compared to 76% of adults.

ACCELERATING SOLUTIONS FOR NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASE
The WHO has identified 20 conditions as “neglected tropical diseases,” including cryptococcal meningitis and visceral leishmaniasis, the second-deadliest
parasitic disease after malaria. Predominant in tropical regions in low- and lower-middle income countries, both diseases can be fatal when left untreated.
Gilead offers a treatment that is key to helping overcome these deadly diseases and plays an important role in our efforts to advance global health. For more
than a decade, we have offered it at no-profit pricing to endemic countries, while working to ensure the long-term availability of its supply through investments
in manufacturing and production capacity. Our actions reflect our status as a signatory to the Kigali Declaration on Preventing, Controlling and Eliminating
Neglected Tropical Diseases. Bangladesh was the first country to achieve elimination of visceral leishmaniasis in 2023, and we are proud of our contributions.
EXPANDING WHO COLLABORATION TO FURTHER ACCESS TO VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS TREATMENTS
For nearly a decade, Gilead has collaborated with the WHO to bring an end to visceral leishmaniasis, a painful
and life-threatening disease characterized by irregular bouts of fever, weight loss, anemia and enlargement
of the spleen and liver.
Highly endemic in 80 countries, visceral leishmaniasis affects some of the world’s poorest people in Brazil,
East Africa and Southeast Asia, where malnutrition, population displacement and poor housing are prevalent.
Since our collaboration with the WHO began, morbidity in Southeast Asia has decreased by more than 82%,
and case fatality has decreased by 95% as part of a comprehensive public health program in this region.
In 2023, we renewed our support to the WHO with a three-year agreement to donate 304,700 vials of medicine
for treating visceral leishmaniasis. Extending through 2025 and estimated at a value of $11.3 million, Gilead
will also provide financial assistance to support improved coverage and access to diagnosis and treatment for
disadvantaged communities in vulnerable, endemic countries.

Gilead sets prices that reflect the value our medicines deliver to patients, healthcare systems and

price to factors such as manufacturing infrastructure, technology adoption and workforce skills.
Our voluntary licensing program is one way we work to overcome these challenges. Drawing on our
global reach and scale, this program empowers generic manufacturers serving low- and lower-middle
income countries by providing the intellectual property framework to manufacture and market generic

for Health Advancement in Vietnam (HAIVN), a collaboration between Brigham and Women’s Hospital,
Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This first-of-its-kind, multiyear
initiative will help address barriers that limit viral hepatitis diagnosis and care at primary healthcare
facilities in these two countries with high burdens of HBV and HCV. In Vietnam, nearly 7.8 million
people are living with HBV and 900,000 are living with HCV, and in the Philippines, over 10 million
people are living with HBV and 450,000 are living with HCV.
Gilead and HAIVN will work together with a multistakeholder coalition, involving national ministries
of health, academic stakeholders such as the University of the Philippines Manila, provincial hospitals
and primary healthcare centers. The coalition will support this program and generate evidence to
transition from a resource-challenged specialist approach to a primary healthcare model of care. We
will educate and empower people with lived experience with viral hepatitis to become advocates
within the health system and community. Our aim is to ensure that the Model of Care (MoC) is people
centered, responding to their needs, ensuring positive experiences and building trust, while also being
clinically effective and efficient.
In the second half of the year, the in-country teams worked closely with partner facilities to prepare
for full implementation of the MoC. This included operationalization workshops to define roles and
responsibilities within the MoC, trialing parts of the pathway, designing and testing healthcare worker
training curricula and course materials, coordinating logistics of specimen transfer systems for viral load
testing, developing information/education/communication materials and more.

INVESTING IN EMERGING VIRUSES RESEARCH
When the global COVID-19 pandemic upended and took the lives of millions of people worldwide, Gilead played a significant role in lessening its impact.
We brought Veklury® (remdesivir 100 mg for injection) to market as the first (and at the time, only) FDA-approved treatment for the disease. Our rapid response
to this pandemic was made possible because it built on decades of antiviral research, using a medicine originally targeted for treating hepatitis C and later
tested during Ebola breakouts in Africa. Despite ultimately proven not to be effective in treating either condition, our scientists were convinced that remdesivir
should continue to be studied and received leadership support to continue the program.
Several years later, remdesivir, proven safe to use in humans based on the Ebola trial, was assessed for its effectiveness in treating COVID-19. Had Gilead not
continued to invest in remdesivir, the impact that Gilead made on patients and alleviating healthcare systems throughout the pandemic could have been unrealized.
Today, our COVID-19 medication continues to be a tool in the treatment of the virus, having been administered to more than 14 million individuals to date.

We have been on a journey over the last few years to define what inclusion and growth looks like for both
employees and leaders at Gilead. This evolution began with the addition of “Inclusion” as a Core Value
in 2016. As time has passed, we have matured our understanding of Inclusion, as well as made substantial
investments through several initiatives, which we describe throughout this chapter.
In conjunction with the definition of a new corporate strategy in 2019, we drafted Leadership
Commitments in an aspirational tone to help guide Gilead toward reaching its bold new ambitions. In
2020, the Leadership Commitments were launched and acknowledged the fact that every employee
contributes to our culture and has an opportunity to lead in their role. Similar to our Core Values, which
are table stakes in the company, the Leadership Commitments apply to all employees and describe
how we need to work together.

The goal of Performance Management at Gilead is to maximize our employees’ performance and growth
while providing a consistent and engaging employee experience. We expect our people leaders to
have ongoing conversations with their employees to stay aligned on goals and expectations, provide
performance feedback and support employee development. Our employees should also proactively seek
feedback and drive their own development. The best performance conversations focus equally on “how”
the work was done, as well as “what” was accomplished.
At the beginning of each year, all 18,000+ employees set “what” goals and “how” goals based on
the Leadership Commitments. All of our people leaders are assigned a predefined “what” goal that
reinforces the People Leader Accountabilities. People leaders host a goal alignment meeting to
encourage coordination across their team. During the year, employees and people leaders have quarterly
check-in conversations that include feedback on performance, development conversations, progress on
or updates to goals and any other timely topics.
People leaders and employees both have access to multirater feedback as a part of the performance
process. We conduct Upward Feedback and a team debrief for all people leaders and Colleague
Input for both people leaders and employees. During the debrief, people leaders are responsible for
sharing impressions and learnings from the feedback given, as well as how they will add it to their
own development plan going forward. The year ends with annual review conversations and rewards
discussions. Throughout the year, we provide just-in-time capability building and resources (e.g.,

Caitlyn Lorenze PAY EQUITY
Global Commercial Product Strategy
Aligned with our aspiration to be respected for equitable and socially
responsible practices, Gilead is a pay-for-performance company committed
to pay equity. This means we make sure employees with similar jobs get paid
similarly, no matter who they are or where they come from. For us, achieving
pay parity isn’t just a matter of principle — it’s an important part of our values
and our commitment to have a workforce that represents the diversity of
the world.
Our employee salaries are based on market-based ranges and assessed
annually in consideration of prior-year performance and competitive
positioning. All compensation decisions are made without regard to gender,
race, color, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender
identity or expression, genetic information, religion or veteran status.
In the U.S., we conduct an annual review of employee compensation to
ensure that our pay practices are race and gender-neutral, and we also
commission an annual global pay equity study to gain a more comprehensive
view of pay equity across the organization.
In 2023, Gilead’s salary ratio for women to men globally was
99.93:100.00.

DEPLOYING RENEWABLE ENERGY
Transitioning to renewable energy sources is an important component of
Gilead’s long-term GHG emissions reduction strategy. As of 2022, 61.7% of our
global electricity demand comes from renewable sources, with 4% coming from
on-site generation from our solar arrays, including significant installations at
facilities in Ireland and the U.S.
As part of our commitment to clean and renewable forms of energy, Gilead
is a member of two initiatives created by the Climate Group, a nonprofit
organization working with businesses and governments globally to address
climate change. As a signatory to the Climate Group’s RE100 initiative, Gilead
has committed to obtaining all the electricity used in our operations from
renewable sources by 2025. We’re also members of Climate Group’s EV100
effort (see Page 83).

DRIVING DOWN EMISSIONS WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVs)
AND SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS
Our participation in the Climate Group’s EV100 initiative signals our commitment to transitioning
our fleet to electric and other low emissions vehicles and increasing our corporate office charging
infrastructure globally. EVs eliminate tailpipe GHG emissions and reduce maintenance time and
costs, when compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.
We continued our company car policy evolution internationally to enable the transition to EVs, with
our operations in France and Spain being the latest to complete such a policy update. In 2023, we also
deployed the first phase of our EV pilot program in the U.S., which aims to replace 10% of our fleet’s
combustion engine vehicles with EVs upon full implementation. In Belgium and the Netherlands, all fleet
vehicles moving forward will now be required to be 100% electric.
Additionally, Gilead has started to use biobased sustainable aviation fuel where possible. We estimate
this effort to have avoided 549 MT GHG emissions in 2023.

OPTIMIZING WATER USE
Pharmaceutical manufacturing is a highly water-dependent process due to
stringent water purity requirements. In 2023, Gilead refined our multiyear
water efficiency road map, setting annual targets that will lead us to our 2030
goals on operational water reduction and water neutrality in water-stressed
regions. Using the third-party Aqueduct Baseline Water Stress screening
tool, we’ve determined that 22% of our locations (excluding our supply chain)
operate in water-stressed basins, and these locations comprised 56% of our
2022 water withdrawal. Achieving our water neutrality goal will benefit local
communities and help safeguard biodiversity and the natural environment
in adjacent areas.
We exceeded our 2023 annualized water-reduction goal by 225%,
achieving a 19,350-cubic meters per year reduction in water usage. Our

Carmen Villar OUR APPROACH TO ESG
ESG & Corporate Citizenship
ESG at Gilead is a value driver that forwards the enterprise vision to create
a healthier world for all people. Our corporate responsibility and sustainability
efforts demonstrate how we are living our ambition to deliver shareholder
value in a sustainable, responsible manner. We are built around four pillars:
scientific innovation, access and health equity, people and sustainability. We
have developed and invested in programs, set ambitious targets and have
engaged stakeholders to ensure that we are focused on the ESG priorities
where we can make the most meaningful difference. ESG principles are
embedded across our value chain, and our 18,000+ global employees are the
means to achieve our bold ambitions.
A key piece of Gilead’s ESG efforts is our focus on governance. Gilead’s
Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) is responsible for the strategic
direction, accountability and review of the impact of our ESG activities. The
CRC draws from cross-functional leadership across Public and Government
Affairs, Human Resources, Legal, Finance, Medical Affairs, Commercial
and Manufacturing. These cross-functional executives ensure there is wide
organizational buy-in while also providing regular feedback to Gilead’s
Board of Directors about ESG activities. The CRC is currently guiding Gilead
through our first double materiality assessment to identify the potentially
material ESG topics from an impact and financial perspective and to assess
the potential impact and opportunities. Upon completion of the double
materiality assessment, we look forward to keeping our employees and
stakeholders informed of any material changes to our ESG strategy.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MANAGEMENT Chan Chea
Tax
OF CONCERNS RELATED TO TAX
We engage with tax authorities with honesty, integrity, respect and fairness and in a spirit of
cooperative compliance. Our tax positions and filings are subject to review and audit by tax
authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business. In the course of such a review, we strive
to be transparent with tax authorities, providing relevant facts and documentation to support
our tax positions and to resolve disputes constructively and in a timely manner on current, future
and past tax risks.
Where appropriate, we also seek to proactively engage with tax authorities on their
interpretation of local tax laws and their application to our specific facts and circumstances.
New tax laws and regulations often bring uncertainty in their interpretation and application, and
inconsistent treatment of a transaction by different jurisdictions brings the risk that the same
income may be taxed by two or more tax authorities. In those situations, we also seek to work
with tax authorities in a transparent manner to mitigate or, if possible, prevent double taxation
of our economic profits, in compliance with tax treaties and applicable national legislation.
We monitor proposals and changes to tax incentives and regulations in the countries in which
we operate in order to assess their impact on our business. From time to time, Gilead may
collaborate with taxpayer advocacy groups to ensure Gilead’s views are considered during the
public discourse. We also support initiatives to increase public trust and transparency in national
and international tax regimes.

ALIGNING WITH THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
Gilead supports all of the 17 UN SDGs. Our business activities are most aligned with the UN SDGs listed below.
Good Health and Wellbeing
We deliver innovative therapies that offer new hope for patients and make our therapies broadly available to people living with,
or at risk from, life-threatening conditions. We go beyond the medicine and help remedy health inequities and other barriers to care.
Our ambitions have led us to a cure for hepatitis C and to transforming the treatment and prevention of HIV. We continue to set our
sights on curing more viral diseases and certain cancers and inflammatory diseases.
Quality Education
We educate and train healthcare providers on advanced therapies, including in resource-limited countries.
Gender Equality
We cultivate an inclusive and diverse workforce that celebrates differences in race, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity
and thinking style. This is exemplified by our gender-neutral pay practices and global pay ratio.
Clean Water and Sanitation
We have committed to achieve water neutrality in water-stressed regions by 2030 and to reduce potable water use at owned facilities
by 30% by 2030.
Affordable and Clean Energy
We generate and purchase renewable energy to offset grid-supplied energy at some of our worldwide facilities. We have committed
to 100% renewable electricity in our operations by 2025 and to transitioning 100% of our fleet to electric or low-emission vehicles and
increasing charging infrastructure by 2030.

Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
We leverage science and innovation to develop industry-leading therapeutics for areas of unmet medical need.
Reduced Inequalities
Inclusion and Diversity is embedded within Gilead’s culture, operations and is a value driver in our efforts to attract and retain
talent. Gilead has a Diversity Council chaired by our CEO, employee resource groups and industry-leading clinical trials focused
on diverse populations.
Responsible Consumption and Production
We have committed to the following: By 2030, reduce total solid waste generated (nonhazardous only, excludes construction and demolition
waste) by 20% compared to 2019, including elimination of single-use plastics (excluding manufacturing and R&D operations),
and achieve zero-waste status through diversion programs. We are also increasing secondary and tertiary product package composition
to 30% post-consumer recycled plastic content and 70% recycled content paper from sustainably managed forests by 2025.
Climate Action
We have committed to reducing absolute GHG emissions across our direct operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 46%, and across our value
chain (Scope 3) by 15%, by 2030, from a 2019 baseline. We have committed to 100% renewable electricity in our operations by 2025
and to transitioning 100% of our fleet to electric or low-emission vehicles and increasing charging infrastructure by 2030. Collectively,
these efforts seek to achieve our ambition of net-zero operational greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
Partnerships for the Goals
We forge internal and external partnerships to improve patient care, strengthen health systems, and reduce social and
environmental impacts.
