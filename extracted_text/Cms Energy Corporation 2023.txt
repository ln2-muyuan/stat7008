CMS Energy provides historical financial results on both a reported (GAAP) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis and provides forward-looking modeling on an adjusted basis. During
an oralpresentation, references to “earnings” are on an adjusted basis. All references to net income refer to net income available to common stockholders and references to
earnings per share are ona diluted basis. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, business optimization
initiative, changes in accounting principles, changes in federal tax policy, regulatory items from prior years, unrealized gainsor losses from mark-to-market adjustments,
recognized in net income related to NorthStar Clean Energy’s interest expense, or other items. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company’s
present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to
measure and assess performance. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential tosignificantly impact, favorably or
unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation forthe comparable
future period earnings. The adjusted earnings should be considered supplemental information to assist in understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for
thereported earnings.
