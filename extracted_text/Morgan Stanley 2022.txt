From Our CEO
Morgan Stanley delivered strong financial results
in 2022 against a complex and challenging
macroeconomic backdrop.
In 2022, we saw significant tightening of monetary policy to combat
record-high inflation, a war in Europe, and continued geopolitical
and political tensions—all of which led to volatile markets and the
weakening of corporate confidence. Amid these uncertainties, the
Firm proved resilient, with strong operating metrics, and we remained
committed to helping our clients and communities.
Our businesses have worked in tandem to embed environmental, social
and governance (ESG) practices and product delivery for clients across
the Firm. This report continues our approach to provide a transparent
view of our ESG efforts, and illustrates the connectivity among our
approaches to diversity and inclusion (D&I), climate and sustainability.
IN 2022:
• We strengthened our focus on improving diverse representation
and belonging across our workforce. We also continued to address
issues of inequity externally through initiatives such as the Equity in
Education and Career Consortium, which is helping drive stronger
career and earnings outcomes for students from low-income
backgrounds.
• I am proud that we have reached over $700Bn toward our goal to mobilize $1Tn in capital for sustainability solutions
by 2030. This progress includes over $550Bn towards low-carbon and green solutions. Teams across the Firm contributed
to this goal by delivering products that align with at least one of 12 eligible sustainability themes.
• We also welcomed a second cohort of five visionary startups from around the world to the Sustainable Solutions
Collaborative. This initiative aims to support concepts with the potential to provide breakthrough innovations by providing
grants of $250,000 to participants to support their work.
At Morgan Stanley, our D&I, climate and sustainability efforts go hand in hand. We have made progress across our business,
with our Firm’s culture guiding our activities. As we continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders, we remain
focused on ESG objectives for our clients, employees and the communities in which we live and work.

S upporting Communities Where We Live and Work
Giving back is deeply rooted in our culture. Morgan Stanley has actively supported
communities around the world for more than 85 years.
Morgan Stanley’s philanthropic efforts support communities
financially and through employee engagement. The
Morgan Stanley Foundation and Morgan Stanley
International Foundation lead these efforts, bringing to
life our core values of giving back and committing to D&I.
In 2022, our Firm, foundations and employees collectively
donated more than $160 million to nonprofit organizations
around the world.
Our Focus on Supporting Children
Though we support a range of charitable causes, we focus
on children's mental and physical health by addressing food
insecurity, creating safe and accessible places to play, and
helping kids grow and thrive.
Amid the youth mental health crisis exacerbated by the
pandemic and social inequity, the Morgan Stanley Alliance
for Children’s Mental Health (Alliance) is actively addressing
the critical challenges of stress, anxiety and depression
in young people. The Alliance supports organizations
through growth capital, nonprofit capacity building, seed
funding and thought leadership. Launched in 2020, Alliance
programs have reached 25 million students, families and
educators globally, many of whom are from diverse and
underserved groups.
In 2022, the Alliance launched its second annual Innovation
Awards to identify and seed-fund transformative mental
health care solutions for children across the United States.
From more than 600 applicants, five grantees were
selected based on their innovative solution: Closegap,

power and auto manufacturing. We are also committed to mobilizing $750 billion to
support low-carbon and green solutions by 2030.
To achieve these goals, we recognize how important it is to operationalize our
commitments in a way that balances the need to rapidly decarbonize the global
economy with the real-world circumstances acutely affecting individuals and
communities. That is why we consider climate as part of our overall business
strategy and approach to risk management.
It is also why I co-chair Morgan Stanley’s Climate Risk Committee, which is focused
on overseeing climate risk considerations throughout Firm processes. Morgan Stanley
is in a unique position to support the climate transition and, looking to the future,
I am excited to continue to work with clients and colleagues to meet our

In September 2020, Morgan Stanley became the first
major U.S.-headquartered global financial services firm to

In November 2021, we announced 2030 interim financed

• Reducing our energy use through efficiencies in our real

As of year-end 2022, our global GHG emissions (from
locations-based accounting) have been reduced by 41%
from a 2012 baseline. We have achieved this reduction
while increasing the number of employees by 43%, with

Transition Risk Scenario Analysis
Transition risk scenario analysis helps Morgan Stanley
understand how a move to a low-carbon economy
may create financial risks to the Firm. Morgan Stanley
leverages regulatory scenarios and scenarios from the
Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the
Financial System (NGFS) for guidance and best-practices
when designing transition risk scenarios. Transition risk
scenarios are chosen based on the Firm’s risk profile,
emerging changes in policies (such as carbon pricing) and
the potential economic impact of such policy changes.
Scenarios may be conducted for different time horizons and
consider exposure concentrations by sector and industry.
To conduct the analysis, FRM leverages existing economic
scenario forecast models as a starting point to develop
climate scenario forecasts. This approach allows FRM to
capture key macroeconomic and financial market variables
across regions and sectors. Climate-specific variables
are then taken from widely recognized industry sources
such as NGFS, or through input from Morgan Stanley
Research. These variables are then incorporated into the
macroeconomic scenarios.

C limate Metrics and Targets
Metrics and targets help track our efforts to achieve our net-zero commitment,
and are important across all four pillars of our climate strategy.
Financed Emissions Lending Intensity—
Interim Target Sectors
We measure progress against our interim net-zero targets
which are based on our financed emissions lending intensity
(FELI) metric. For an in-depth explanation of this metric,
please see the Methodology for Morgan Stanley’s 2030
Interim Financed Emissions Targets on the Path to Net-Zero.
We announced our 2030 interim emission reduction targets
in late 2021 and set our emissions baseline year as 2019. On
page 55, we disclose our financed emissions lending intensity
(FELI) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 (for more detail on our 2019
baseline emissions data, see our 2021 Climate Report).
It is important to note that these results reflect lending
activities prior to the establishment of our interim targets,
set in November 2021. The three years of FELI data reported
cover a timeframe during which our business activities
were not managed to our commitment to net-zero financed
emissions. We provide these figures for reference.

Looking Forward
These challenges are industry-wide and not specific to
our method of tracking emissions or our clients’ production
activities. As data improves, we expect reported emissions
to be more representative of actual emissions from their
underlying activities, and thus more accurately reflect how
our clients are working to address their own emissions
footprint.
For this reason, we encourage companies across all sectors,
especially high-emitting sectors, to report emissions data
accurately and comprehensively and to also restate prior
years, where appropriate.
We remain committed to our net-zero and interim emissions
targets. As detailed in the section “Our Approach to the Net-
Zero Transition”, we have a clear strategy to engage with
our clients to meet our commitments and reduce FELI over
time, including by leveraging a range of data to help drive
decisions. Our CSAF framework will provide forward-looking
data on our clients which complements GHG emissions data,
which are historical.
As stated in our public methodology document, we view
this journey as iterative, and we will continue to evolve our
approach as the data and disclosure evolves. To that end,
we will evaluate our sources of data, our target methodology
and our disclosure options over time to help ensure the
metrics that we publicly report are aligned with our
business and our clients’ activities.

Example of Updated Company Disclosure Leading to Year-over-Year Discrepancy
Year-over-year variances in reported emissions are not necessarily correlated with an Energy company’s production and related end-use
emissions. The data in this example has been anonymized but is representative of a change in emissions values disclosed by a company and
the values reported by data providers.
For the first time, an oil and gas producer disclosed its emissions for the most recent year (2021) and the previous year (2020). A data
provider which used a production-based estimate for the company’s 2020 emissions pivots to utilize the company’s reported value for 2021
emissions. However, the data provider does not retroactively revise or restate its prior year estimate for the company’s 2020 emissions.
In this example, there is a resulting discrepancy between the company’s reported change in emissions (-20% YoY) and the implied change
(+300% YoY), while erroneously demonstrating an inverse relationship to annual production which decreased (-5%) over the same period.
Our goal in sharing this case study is to illustrate the complexities in the data dynamics which drive the results of our FELI emissions.
Over time, we expect increased company reporting and consistency in the relationship between emissions data as reported and underlying

Leadership Statement
As Chief Sustainability Officer and CEO of the Institute
for Sustainable Investing, I am proud of the work
Morgan Stanley has done to mobilize capital in ways that
drive systemic and sustainable change around the world.
As the landscape around ESG continues to grow increasingly complex, we remain
committed to leveraging our expertise to serve the sustainability needs of our clients,
our communities and our colleagues. We also recognize that today’s sustainability
challenges are truly global in nature. That is why, in 2022, we expanded the footprint
of our Global Sustainability Office to Europe. With our newly launched Firm ESG
Committee, we are ensuring that Morgan Stanley continues to increase connectivity
and improve accountability across the Firm.
It is an incredibly exciting time to be focused on sustainability. With ever-increasing
demands and a steady stream of innovations across the field, my role as Chief
Sustainability Officer will continue to align directly with our Firm’s core values of
doing the right thing and putting clients first in the transition to a low-carbon,
sustainable and inclusive economy.

To Those Charged with Governance:
We have reviewed the assertion of Morgan Stanley management that its Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3,
Category 6 (Business travel) and Scope 3, Category 13 (Downstream leased assets) Greenhouse Gas
Emissions metrics presented within the Morgan Stanley 2022 ESG Report as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (referred to as the “subject matter”) are presented in accordance with the Greenhouse
Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) published by the World
Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (the “criteria”). Morgan Stanley
management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the subject
matter based on our review.
Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to
obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the subject matter
in order for it to be presented in accordance with the criteria. The procedures performed in a review vary
in nature and timing from and are substantially less in extent than an examination, the objective of which
is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the subject matter is presented in accordance with the
criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is
substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been
performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our conclusion.
We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical requirements in accordance with the
Code of Professional Conduct issued by the AICPA. We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards
established by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In performing our review, we
performed analytical procedures, inquiries, and other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. For a selection of the subject matter, we performed tests of mathematical accuracy of
computations, compared the specified information to underlying records, or observed the data collection
process.
The preparation of the subject matter included within the Morgan Stanley 2022 ESG Report requires
management to interpret the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be
included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported information. Measurement of certain
amounts and metrics may include estimates and assumptions that are subject to substantial inherent
measurement uncertainty, including for example, the accuracy and precision of conversion factors or
estimation methodologies used by management. Obtaining sufficient appropriate review evidence to
support our conclusion does not reduce the inherent uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. The selection
by management of a different but acceptable measurement method, input data, or model assumptions,
may have resulted in materially different amounts and metrics being reported.
Information outside of the subject matter was not subject to our review and, accordingly, we do not express
a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information. Further, any information relating to periods
prior to the year-ended December 31, 2022, or information relating to forward-looking statements, targets,
goals, progress against goals, and linked information was not subject to our review and, accordingly, we do
not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the subject
matter in order for it to be presented in accordance with the criteria.
