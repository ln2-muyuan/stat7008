Our Blueprint EFFICIENCY & EXCELLENCE
for Success We assess building performance using ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager®. We use the platform
to collect data, benchmark against peers and gain insight for implementing building efficiency
strategies around emissions, energy, water and waste. In 2022, we benchmarked over 1,400
properties in Portfolio Manager, representing coverage of 75% of our portfolio across 83 operators.
Our blueprint for success relies on quality data, which we are able to obtain thanks to strong
relationships with our valued seniors housing operators and outpatient medical teams. We
provide new operators with tools and resources to share and update their utility data regularly and
contribute to our collective success.
Education & Support
Launched in 2019, our "Performance Playbook: A Guide for Senior Housing Efficiency and
Excellence" continues to be an important engagement tool for our seniors housing operators.
The Playbook and accompanying resources provide information and actionable guidance on topics
such as:
• Preventative maintenance programs
• Energy, water and waste efficiency and improvements
• Indoor air quality
• Smart purchasing

• Set a new, near-term target, in line with the Science Based Targets initiative’s well-below
2oC scenario
• Doubled our green power purchasing compared to the prior year
• Offset over 51,000 MWh of electricity usage with 100% renewable energy credits
• Reduced Scope 1 & 2 emissions intensity by 6.8% from 2021 to 2022

EDUCATION & DATA COVERAGE
Quality and complete data are essential to sustainable buildings. To improve data coverage,
Welltower engaged operators earlier in the year to provide more time to gather, troubleshoot and
upload data. We offered one-on-one support for operators with particularly challenging data issues.
We partnered with the EPA to provide Portfolio Manager benchmarking training for our outpatient
medical property managers. On the backend, Welltower teams cleaned up property profiles in
ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager® which allowed for a smoother data QAQC process. As a result of
these efforts, data coverage improved by over 10%, resulting in 75%+ data coverage.

Our Board’s legacy lives on through continued dedication and impact across our ESG values and initiatives. In 2022, we were proud to honor two
former directors.
• The Sharon Oster Scholarship In memory of Sharon M. Oster, former Welltower director of 27 years, this scholarship will be awarded annually to
a female Welltower intern attending graduate school. The recipient will demonstrate a scholarly deliberateness of purpose, commitment to team
building and collaboration, and the power of mentorship, particularly of women and minorities.
• The “Above and Beyond” Leadership Award In honor of Jeffrey Donahue, who served on the Welltower Board of Directors for 24 years, this
annual award was created to recognize Welltower employees who embody Jeff’s legacy of service, willingness to go the extra mile, and his wit and
pragmatism. The award will also honor an employee who exemplifies Jeff’s connection to community and respect for Welltower’s culture, and who
inspires these same attributes in other employees.

CONDENSED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT PLAN
All properties owned by Welltower throughout the entirety (or a portion) of calendar year 2022 are included in the entity's reporting boundaries and portfolio composition for this reporting year. Loans (0%
ownership), properties under construction and land are excluded from the asset list and are outside of the reporting boundaries for Welltower. Welltower defines its control boundary using the financial control
approach. Under this approach, medical office buildings that are directly managed by Welltower and seniors housing properties in Welltower’s portfolio are included within the control boundary (Scope 1 and
2), with triple-net SHO properties considered outside of the financial boundary and included in Scope 3. An inventory management plan (IMP) was developed and describes the data sources and methodology
used to prepare Welltower’s 2022 greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. Both the IMP and an accompanying GHG inventory are created in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Corporate Accounting and
Reporting Standard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) guidance and best practices for calculation emissions associated with Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources and Indirect
Emissions from Purchased Electricity.
1.Energy, water and waste utility data, along with the year-end property list, is the source information for all calculations in the GHG inventory.
2.Utility data is assigned to the sample groups if operational days for the property were 365 and if there were 5 or fewer days difference between days on meter and operational days.
3.Emissions regions are assigned by country. a.) US – assigned an eGRID subregion based on zip code. b.) Canada – assigned a region by province. c.) UK – are all included in the same region.
4.Emissions are calculated for each energy commodity in units of metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The IPCC SAR global warming potentials are used to calculate the CO2 equivalent.
5.The following assumptions were applied this year: a.) District hot water calculations assume district hot water is generated using a natural gas fuel source and that there’s a 20% loss of energy (divide by 0.8). b.)
Although square footage for corporate offices was not provided, EUI checks were deemed unnecessary as consumption in corporate offices was confirmed complete.
6.Employee Commuting: a.) The home and work address report is used to calculate emissions associated with employee commuting. Miles traveled per employee are calculated using the following assumptions: i.)
Employees commute round trip, 48 weeks per year, 5 days per week. ii.) Exclusions: 1.) NYC employees since they generally take mass transit. 2.) Employees designated as permanently remote and those living
greater than 70 miles from an office. b.) Average fuel economy for passenger vehicles data was obtained from the DOT website to calculate gallons of fuel used in commuting.
7. Business Travel: a.) Reports from travel vendors are used to calculate the number of miles flown in the reporting year. b.) Flights are categorized as short haul, medium haul, and long haul based on the following
criteria: flights < 300 air miles are short haul, flights between 300 and 2,300 air miles are medium haul, and flights above 2,300 air miles are long haul. c.) DEFRA/DECC emissions factors for each flight category
are used to calculate emissions from business travel in units of metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
8.Waste: a.) If the waste data is reported in volume, not weight, then use EPA waste volume to weight conversion factors to convert to weight. b.) The year over year fluctuations in waste data are due to changes in
data coverage as no waste data is estimated. Diverted waste includes recycled and composted waste.
9.In the absence of actual data for properties in Welltower’s portfolio, estimates are applied based on an EUI from the sample group. Utility data is assigned to the sample group if operational days for the property
were 365 and if there were 5 or fewer days difference between days on meter and operational days. Additionally, 2022 consumption for headquarters is unavailable, so 2021 data is used as an estimate.

LRQA Independent Assurance Statement
Relating to Welltower Inc.’s GHG Emissions and Sustainability Data for the
calendar year 2022
This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Welltower Inc. in accordance with our contract.
Terms of Engagement
LRQA was commissioned by Welltower Inc. (Welltower) to provide independent assurance of its greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions inventory and Sustainability Data (“the Report”) for the calendar year (CY) 2022 against the
assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier.
The assurance was performed using LRQA’s verification procedure and ISO 14064 - Part 3 for greenhouse gas
emissions. LRQA’s verification procedure is based on current best practise and is in accordance with ISAE 3000 and
ISAE 3410.
Our assurance engagement covered Welltower’s operations and activities for their properties in the United States,
Canada and the United Kingdom and specifically the following requirements:
• Verifying conformance with:
• Welltower’s reporting methodologies for the selected datasets; and
• World Resources Institute / World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas
Protocol: A corporate accounting and reporting standard, revised edition (otherwise referred to as the
WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol) for the GHG data1.
• Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information for only the selected indicators listed below:
• Direct (Scope 1), Energy Indirect (Scope 2) and Other Indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions.
▪ Scope 3 GHG emissions verified by LRQA were limited to Business travel (Air), Employee
commuting, Waste generated in operations and Downstream leased assets.
• Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions intensity;
• Energy use intensity data;
• Water consumption for approximately 73% of properties, based on property sq. ft.;
• Measured waste & recycling data;
• Workforce diversity and remuneration data; and
• Safety metrics.
The GHG emissions data was reported using the Financial Control consolidation approach and covered properties
only for the period under Welltower ownership during the reporting year. Investments categorized as fixed assets
under the GHG Protocol, including land, loans and development projects, were excluded from the reporting. Direct
fugitive GHG emissions from Refrigeration and Air Conditioning equipment were excluded on the basis of their de
minimis contribution to the GHG emissions inventory.
LRQA’s responsibility is only to Welltower. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the
end footnote. Welltower’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and
information within the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the Report
is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of Welltower.
1. http://www.ghgprotocol.org/
LRQA’s Opinion
Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that Welltower has not,
in all material respects:
• Met the requirements of the criteria listed above; and
• Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and information as summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3 below.
The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance2 and at the materiality of the professional
judgement of the verifier.
Table 1. Summary of Welltower’s GHG Emissions for CY 2022:
Scope of GHG emissions Tonnes CO2e
Scope 1 Total 180,316

Scope 3 Category 13 - Downstream leased assets
• Electricity Location-Based 190,721
• Natural Gas 68,185
• Propane 1,007
• Fuel Oil No. 2 344
Note 1: Scope 2, Location-based and Market-based are defined in the GHG Protocol Scope 2
Guidance, 2015.

Electricity, Natural Gas & Fuels Use Intensity1 22.36 kWh/sqft
Scope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions Intensity 5.62 Tonnes CO2e/1,000 sqft
1. Data covers properties within financial control boundary and downstream leased assets
2. Water use data covers 73% of properties based on property square feet
3. Total waste generated data covers 20% of properties based on property square feet
4. Waste recycled data covers 11% of properties based on property square feet
2. The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement.
Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. Consequently,
the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than the assurance that would have been obtained
had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

Ethnic Diversity, ‘Not Specified’ includes employees located outside of the US.
LRQA’s Approach
LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure. The following tasks
were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:
• Interviewing relevant employees of the organization responsible for managing GHG emissions and
Sustainability data and records;
• Assessing Welltower’s data management systems to confirm they are designed to prevent significant errors,
omissions or misstatements in the Report. We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling
procedures, instructions and systems, including those for internal quality control; and
• Verifying historical GHG emissions and Sustainability data and records at an aggregated level for CY 2022.
LRQA’s Standards, Competence and Independence
LRQA implements and maintains a comprehensive management system that meets accreditation requirements for
ISO 14065 Greenhouse gases – Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in
accreditation or other forms of recognition and ISO/IEC 17021 Conformity assessment – Requirements for bodies
providing audit and certification of management systems that are at least as demanding as the requirements of the
International Standard on Quality Control 1 and comply with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued
by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants.
LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and
experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior
management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent.
