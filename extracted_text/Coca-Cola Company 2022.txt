externally assured data; one exception was approved for internally validated and verified data. The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long-term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies annually. Replenish benefits fall under three categories:
Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (17.4 BL). Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities in 2019–2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless otherwise
stated, in this report finished beverages is based on global sales volume. Approximately 13.5 BL (approx. 7%) of the water used in our beverages that we returned to nature and communities is from 7 projects located in Ukraine and Belarus where since May 2019 we have not
been able to monitor projects on intervals aligned with internal guidelines due to COVID and the ongoing war.
