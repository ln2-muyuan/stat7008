CEO STATEMENT
I am pleased to share with you our 2023 environmental, social and governance (ESG) achievements. We
have made tremendous progress.
At Howmet, our more than 23,000 global employees are dedicated to manufacturing high-performance
engineered solutions with determination, integrity and purpose. Our products play a crucial role in
enabling fuel efficiency and lightweighting, contributing to our customers’ success and making a positive
impact on the world.
In the face of the current economic climate, building a sustainable and resilient business has never been
more critical. Despite challenges, we experienced a commendable 17 percent growth in revenue in 2023
that was driven by healthy demand in the aerospace and defense segments.
As we navigate these dynamic times, our commitment to growing sustainably and delivering on our key
ESG commitments remains unwavering.
Progress in Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
In 2023, we marked the second year of our three-year target to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions from our own operations by 21.5 percent versus our 2019 baseline. Through strategic
improvements in the efficiency of our production processes, we successfully avoided 25,000 metric tons
of these emissions, achieving a 13.6 percent intensity improvement. Our absolute emissions were
19.8 percent lower than our 2019 baseline at the end of 2023.
We are also progressing well on our water withdrawal and hazardous waste reduction targets.
Forward-looking GHG Targets Aligning with Paris Goals
Looking ahead, we have established ambitious GHG reduction targets for 2025-2027 that align with the
Paris goals and aim for a 33.6 percent absolute reduction from our 2019 baseline. To achieve these
targets, we have developed credible plans that leverage process efficiencies, renewables and green
power procurement. These initiatives underscore our commitment to environmental responsibility and
our role in contributing to global climate goals.
Safety Culture
Safety is paramount in our operations, and our commitment to a safe and secure work environment
is embedded in our culture. I am pleased to report that we closed the year with no fatalities or serious
injuries among our employees and contractors. Our incident performance remained strong, reflecting
our ongoing dedication to the well-being of our workforce.
Enhancing Supply Chain Sustainability with New Due Diligence
Process
In tandem with our commitment to sustainability, we have partnered with industry peers to launch a
collaborative supplier due diligence process. This initiative is designed to enhance the efficiency and
transparency of information exchange within our supply chain. By jointly assessing ESG criteria, we aim
4
CEO STATEMENT
to establish a robust framework that elevates standards across the industry. We firmly believe that such
collaborative efforts are essential in promoting responsible business practices and fostering positive
change within our supply chain.
Investing in Exceptional Talent and Diversity
We recognize that our long-term ESG, sustainability and economic performance hinges on the
exceptional talent, skills and passion of our employees. As such, we are proud that we have been
honored with awards for our commitment to the diversity, health and professional development of our
workforce. While we celebrate the progress made in our diversity metrics, we acknowledge that there is
more work ahead and remain committed to fostering an inclusive workplace.
Showcasing Our Metrics
We recognize that true sustainability is a journey of continuous improvement. To this end, we remain
dedicated to transparency and accountability. That is why we have expanded the comprehensive data
on our ESG performance at the end of this report.
Our ESG performance is rigorously monitored and assessed against international standards, and we
actively seek feedback from stakeholders to guide our future initiatives. By regularly communicating our
progress and challenges, we aim to foster a culture of openness and collaboration.
I extend my gratitude to our employees, partners and stakeholders for their ongoing dedication to
advancing our ESG performance. Together, we are shaping a future where responsible business
practices and sustainability go hand in hand.

budgets, heightening the need for new solutions
that reduce fuel consumption. Stringent emission
regulations have accelerated electric truck devel-
opment, but battery weight presents difficulties
and generates demand for products that promote
weight reduction.
According to the 2023 State of Transportation
Report from Breakthrough, 94 percent of transpor-
tation leaders agreed that consumer demand for
more sustainable products makes reducing emis-
sions a more critical priority. In addition, 99 percent
of shippers agreed they would take advantage
of electric or alternative energy vehicles, and 59
percent said they would add electric vehicles by the
end of 2023. This data highlights the importance of
lightweight and aerodynamic products.

CASE STUDY
Exeter Harnesses Sun’s Power
The 1,025 solar panels atop the roof of the core facility building at our Exeter, U.K., location provide
around 20 percent of the building’s annual electricity, giving a glimpse at one way we will reduce our
energy costs and achieve our reduction goals for greenhouse gas emissions.
Completed in January 2023, the solar project is one of the first in the company and produces up to
380 megawatt hours of electricity each year, which is enough to power 131 average U.K. homes. All the
array’s energy is consumed on-site and not sent to the grid.
In 2022, the plant’s energy costs were six times higher than they were previously. Strategically, it was a
good time to look at installing solar, especially since the estimated return on the US$284,000 investment
was 2.6 years.
The plant uses a combination of natural gas and electricity to power its operations, which produce aero-
space and industrial gas turbine components. The solar array provides less than 2 percent of the site’s
annual electricity consumption but 20 percent for the 2,500-square-meter (26,910-square-foot) building
where it’s installed. On sunny days, the contribution can climb to more than 50 percent.

Eliminating Waste at Its Source
From neutralizing acidic wastewater to diverting steam condensate from the hazardous waste stream,
three of our U.S. locations have reduced their collective hazardous and non-hazardous waste by nearly
1,540 metric tons in 2023.
Descaling, where chemicals are used to remove contaminants and imperfections from a metal surface,
historically accounted for a third of our Niles, Ohio, plant’s hazardous waste. By neutralizing the acidic
wastewater onsite before sending it offsite for further treatment and disposal, the location eliminated
250 metrics tons of hazardous waste annually. The site also began working with a supplier to recycle the
sand-like garnet used in its cutting processes, diverting 1,000 metric tons of non-hazardous waste from
the landfill each year.
When trench waste, which is overflow from chemical tanks, spiked significantly at our Torrance,
California, location in 2022, a root-cause analysis found that operators were accidentally overfilling the
tanks. By installing an inexpensive dosing unit that automatically controls the volume of liquid being
added to a tank, the location reduced its hazardous waste by 58 metric tons in 2023 compared to the
prior year .
At our Cleveland Works location, tanks containing caustic and acid that are used in the etching process
are heated with steam. While the steam never came into direct contact with the chemical bath, its con-
densate was discharged into the bottom of the tank system, where it comingled with a tank’s hazardous
waste.
Through a process change that isolates the condensate, the location now annually discharges 10
metric tons – 100 percent – of this non-hazardous water from one of its two large aerospace etching
lines through the sewer system. The process change will be extended to the plant’s second etching
line in 2024. The location also used analytical data to extend how often a tank’s caustic and acid bath is
changed, eliminating an additional 219 metric tons of hazardous waste each year.

Spill Simulation Unifies Emergency Responders
With water serving as a substitute for hydroflu-
oric acid, a simulated major spill at our Cleveland
Works facility brought together nearly 60 internal
and external responders to coordinate a unified
response to the highly unlikely situation.
Because the location has onsite containment to
keep spills from breaching the building, the drill
simulated a release of hydrofluoric acid from a
tanker truck transporting chemical residuals for off-
site processing. Such a spill, which is a worst-case
scenario for the plant, requires effective coordina-
tion between the internal and external emergency
responders to minimize the impact.
Joining our onsite emergency response team, medi-
cal team and contract security personnel in the drill
were representatives from the Cuyahoga Heights and Newburgh Heights fire departments, Southwest
Emergency Response Team (SERT) hazmat team and Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District.
The four-hour drill, which was conducted in August 2023, had multiple goals:
• Provide site personnel with the opportunity to practice the skills needed for real emergencies, such as
implementing the response system, coordinating and communicating, and securing the scene;
• Allow these employees to practice collaborating with outside emergency response agencies to
increase interoperability in dynamic situations; and
• Increase the emergency response agencies’ familiarity with the facility, personnel and processes in
advance of a potential real emergency .
“Although the site has very good regular communi-
cation with our fire department, the drill gave us an
even better understanding of what’s in the plant as
well as its processes,” said Reno Contipelli, retired
fire lieutenant, Cuyahoga Heights Fire Department.
“In the event there’s an incident, everyone will be
aligned on how to handle it. Building these relation-
ships before there’s a crisis is very important.”
A debriefing following the drill identified opportu-
nities for further improvement, including a better
strategy for initial scene isolation and increased
employee and contractor education on the facility’s
barricade program and spill kit locations.

employee’s story full circle.
In October 2023, our Acuña operations in Mexico
and the Howmet Hispanic Network (HHN) received
a plaque for their support of nonprofit Hand of
the Niño, which primarily awards scholarships to
students who have the desire and drive to fur-
ther their education. The organization’s founder,
Mike Figart, and one of its teachers, Carmen
Marquez Avilla, visited the location to recognize
the US$10,000 Howmet Foundation grants their
organization received in 2022 and 2023 due to
HHN’s efforts.
Cinthia Cortes, who works as a purchasing analyst at the location, saw Mike and Carmen while they were
visiting and was brought to tears. Cinthia was helped by Hand of the Niño nearly a decade prior.
“I started crying because it was the first time I had seen them in so many years,” said Cinthia. “I wanted to
give them thanks for allowing me to be in the position that I am.”
Cinthia was not aware of our involvement with The Hand of the Niño and did not know that Mike and
Carmen would be on-site that day.
“I was pregnant in high school and had no resources to continue my schooling,” she said. “I had to
stop going to school to give birth to my son, but the support that I received from The Hand of the Niño
allowed me to go back and finish high school. The organization helped me pay for school, helped me
with childcare and helped take care of me.”
The organization also provided financial support for Cinthia to attend college and study enterprise
engineering .
“I’m very thankful for everything Hand of the Niño did for me,” said Cinthia. “I felt like I had lost my oppor-
tunity. The organization gave me hope and allowed me to continue my studies.”
Cinthia said that it’s “unbelievable” that after so many years, she’s in a place that supports a cause that
helped her so much.
“It’s a great organization that gives opportunities to people without judging who you are or what you did,”
Cinthia added. “Its people open their arms and inspire you to move forward.”

Employee Engagement and
Empowerment
We support a safety culture in which employees feel
comfortable communicating health and safety ques-

their views and opinions so we can proactively iden-

Health and safety programs can only be truly effec-
tive if they include employee input and feedback.
Ensuring broad engagement – both formally and
informally – is at the center of our program deploy-
