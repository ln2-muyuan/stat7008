CEO INTRODUCTION
We are committed to the highest standards of patient safety and quality in our products
and services and to world-class integrity and ethical business practices.
Every day, our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world moves us
forward. Our team members believe in it, our customers count on it and patients depend on it. Our mission
is at the heart of everything we do, and with it comes great responsibility to strong corporate citizenship,
ensuring we drive positive results – for people and the planet.
Driven by that responsibility, Zimmer Biomet is increasingly focused on advancing our environmental,
social and governance (ESG) initiatives to drive long-term value for our stakeholders. In 2022 we invested
further by developing a comprehensive sustainability strategy focused on three key priorities: being a
best and preferred place to work; a trusted partner through world-class compliance, quality and ethics
commitments; and driving efficiency and top quartile business performance while minimizing operational
risk and enhancing ESG disclosures.
I am pleased to report that in 2022 we continued to make significant strides in accomplishing our goals and
commitments, including:
• Achieved our 2022 milestone towards Zimmer Biomet’s 2026 DEI representation goals for women
globally, and people of color in the U.S. at the director-level and above, while also publicly disclosing
EEO-1 data for the first time
• Launched our Best & Preferred Place to Work strategy focused on shared purpose, deeper
connections, holistic well-being and professional and personal growth
• Continued progress on our quality management programs and
performance, maintaining fewer than 10 product recalls in the year
• Earned a Leadership Level grade of A- from the Carbon Disclosure
Project
• Continued progress on our Science Based Target Initiative-
approved goal to reduce our operational (Scope 1 + 2)
emissions 50% and purchased goods and services (Scope 3)
emissions 15% by 2030
• Upgraded to ‘AA’ ESG rating by MSCI in February 2023
I am proud of Zimmer Biomet’s nearly 100-year legacy and humbled
to be a part of it. As I reflect on our past, I also envision a bold future—
one that is not only sustainable, but also equitable and just.
Thank you for your continuing support.

Report of Independent Accountants
To the Board of Directors of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.
We have reviewed the accompanying management assertion of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”)
that the Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions metrics (metrics) for the year ended December
31, 2022 in management’s assertion are presented in accordance with the assessment criteria set forth in
management’s assertion. The Company’s management is responsible for its assertion and for the selection of the
criteria, which management believes provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the metrics. Our
responsibility is to express a conclusion on management’s assertion based on our review.
Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements,
and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to
obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to management’s assertion
in order for it to be fairly stated. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from, and are
substantially less in extent than, an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether management’s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of
assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an
examination been performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion.
We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant
ethical requirements related to the engagement.
The firm applies the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly,
maintains a comprehensive system of quality control.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In performing our review, we
performed inquiries, performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations on a sample basis, read relevant
policies to understand terms related to relevant information about the metrics, and reviewed supporting
documentation in regard to the completeness and accuracy of the data in the metrics on a sample basis.
GHG emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things
as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to calculate GHG emissions, and the inability of
these models, due to incomplete scientific knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all
circumstances the relationship between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and
energy use data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature and the
methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement
techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.
As discussed in management’s assertion, the Company has estimated GHG emissions for certain emissions
sources for which no primary usage data is available.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the Company’s
management assertion in order for it to be fairly stated.

The Company uses the operational control approach (as discussed in the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting
Standard, see footnote 1 below) to account for and report its metrics. This approach includes sites identified in Table 1 below.
The following type of sites are excluded from the metrics: commercial or sales, storage of non-product materials, field inventory
storage (node 2), third-party logistics facilities, residential structures, and sub-leased facilities. See footnote 7 below for the
methodology used for acquired and divested sites.

GHG Emissions Disclosures
1. The Company considers the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council
for Sustainable Development’s (WBCSD) The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard,
Revised Edition, and GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance: An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (together the
“GHG Protocol”) to guide the criteria to assess, calculate and report GHG emissions.
2. GHG emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG
emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to calculate GHG emissions, and the inability of these models, due to
incomplete scientific knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship between
various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use data used in GHG emissions calculations are
subject to inherent limitations, given the nature and the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management
of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being
reported.
3. Actual or estimated energy and fuel usage from emissions sources is utilized for calculating emissions. The usage is multiplied
by the relevant emission factor and global warming potential (GWP). A general formula for calculating emissions is:
• Usage x Emission Factor x Global Warming Potential = Metric Tons CO2e Emissions.
• GHG emissions are calculated in metric tons of CO2 equivalents (or “CO2e”) using the GWP taken from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 – 100 year) published in 2014. CO2e
emissions are calculated by multiplying actual or estimated energy and fuel usage by the relevant emission factor and
GWP of the subject gases. All emission factors are updated annually where applicable. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)
emissions are inclusive of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are emitted but excluded from our reporting. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen
trifluoride (NF3) are not emitted by the Company.
4. Related to Scope 1 GHG emissions:
• Natural gas:
a. Combustion from stationary equipment and machinery at the Company’s sites.
b. Global natural gas usage data was collected from monthly utility invoices obtained from third-party providers or
based on an annual summary report obtained from said third-party providers.
c. Where a monthly utility invoice or an annual summary report was not available, the Company estimated natural
gas usage by determining an average monthly natural gas usage rate based on available monthly invoices for other
months for the site.
• Propane and diesel:
a. Combustion from emergency and portable generators, powered industrial vehicles (e.g., forklifts), and temporary
space heaters used at sites.
b. Global propane and diesel usage data was collected from invoices and fuel reports obtained from third-party
providers or based on an annual summary report obtained from said third-party providers.
c. No estimates were necessary for global propane and diesel usage as actual usage data was available for each site.
• Estimated emissions from the sources above account for approximately 1% of the reported Scope 1 GHG emissions.
• Scope 1 GHG emissions excluded:
a. Mobile combustion: Combustion from the operation of the Company’s diesel and gasoline global vehicle fleet and
aviation fuel from the operation of aircraft used for Company business
b. Fugitive emissions (e.g., refrigerants)
37
5. Related to Scope 2 GHG emissions:
• Purchased Electricity:
a. GHG emissions from the generation of electricity purchased by the Company for use at the Company’s sites.
b. Global electricity usage data was collected from monthly utility invoices obtained from third-party providers or
based on an annual summary report obtained from said third-party providers.
c. Where a monthly utility invoice or an annual summary report was not available, the Company estimated electricity
usage by determining an average monthly electricity usage rate based on available monthly invoices for other
months for the site.
• Estimated emissions from purchased electricity account for less than 1% of the reported Scope 2 GHG location-based
and market-based emissions.
• Scope 2 GHG emissions excluded:
a. Emissions from steam, heating, and cooling
6. The Company used the following emission factors per emission type and source in the calculation of GHG emissions:
• Scope 1 GHG emissions: United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Center for Corporate Climate
Leadership, Emissions Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (April 2022).
• Scope 2 GHG emissions (location-based):
• U.S.: U.S. EPA Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGrid) subregion emission factors for 2021
(January 2023)
• All other countries: International Energy Agency (IEA) Emissions Factors 2022 (September 2022)
• Scope 2 GHG emissions (market-based):
• The Company has two contractual instruments for renewable electricity procurement: 1) Virtual Power Purchase
Agreement (VPPA) to purchase renewable energy credits (RECs) to be applied to cover electricity usage at U.S.
sites and 2) Green Power Contract for one specific location for the period June 25, 2021 through June 24, 2022 for
which the kilowatt hours (KWh) have been applied to electricity usage for the year ended December 31, 2022. The
RECs applicable to 2022 associated with the VPPA and Green Power Contract have been retired as of the date of
this management assertion. Any remaining electricity usage was converted to emissions using the grid-average
emission factors as described below.
i. The Company uses supplier specific emission factors for electricity when available
ii. Europe: Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) European Residual Mixes Emission Factors 2021 (May 2022)
iii. The Company uses the location-based emission factors if a supplier specific or residual mix emission factor
is not available
7. The methodology used for acquired/divested sites is as follows:
• In 2022, there have been no acquisitions.
• In 2022, the Company has divested of ZimVie Inc. (ZimVie), its Dental and Spine business, as of March 1, 2022. Emissions
for the sites related to the ZimVie business have been included for the period prior to the divestiture (January and
February 2022).
